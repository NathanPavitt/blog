BODY:
<p><em>&quot;increased competition, rapidly shifting technologies, and emerging disruptive business models — are the forces that are reshaping many parts of the global economy. &quot;</em> - <strong>Scott Anthony</strong>, talking on Harvard Business Online, talking about the impact of the new norm on the global Magazine industry. He then continues on to use the phrase &quot;Constant Transformation is the new normal&quot;. I liked it. I&#39;m not overly fond of the &quot;new normal&quot; (used by McKinsey, the Economist, and an obscure album by an Australian prog rock band called Cog), or the &quot;<em>new norm</em>&quot; (used by MCA, ourselves and others) ... in fact I&#39;m still searching for a term that effectively describes the new all connected, IT-enabled world in which we will all inhabit.</p>

<p><strong>Constant Transformation</strong> is a nice way to describe it. I&#39;ve talked about &quot;<em>impending chaos</em>&quot;, &quot;<em>accelerated decision making</em>&quot;, &quot;<em>extreme collaboration</em>&quot; and more, but Constant Transformation more effectively describes the environment in which we and our clients will be operating in. It echoes the need to always follow the accelerated and urgent business need, the new technological possibilities and the new cultural transformation (GenX &amp; GenY, with Gen Z soon to hit) that is now on us all - a perfect storm.</p>

<p>Earlier in the decade, our marketing team coined the phrase &quot;<em>Clarity from Complexity</em>&quot;. It was an effective term for translating the complexity of IT requirements, applications and services into some simplified sense and order that both the business and the users of the system or services could exploit. It was effective at the time - IT contracts had grown too large, too complex, too prone to failure. The model has now changed - the contracts are smaller, one size no longer fits all. But the transformational need is ever present - just needed faster. Now we need to drive &quot;<em>Clarity during Constant Transformation</em>&quot;.<br />What do we mean?</p>

EXTENDED BODY:

<p>I&#39;ve just read a McKinsey white paper on Business Technology: &quot;<em>Time to raise the CIO&#39;s game</em>&quot;. There isn&#39;t anything new in it, but it reads well - it re-emphasises the need to focus on cost, to talk the language of the business, to step up productivity, to drive top-line company revenues and the need to collaborate. It offers Web2.0, SaaS and Cloud as emergent technologies that drive that change. And it rightly mentions the shift from an ordered process - the need for &quot;<em>best practice</em>&quot; controls and structure, to one that is more of a mind-set shift, &quot;emphasise a bottom-up search for value through experimentation with customers and partners.&quot; Again, good stuff, but so what? It tells me nothing about when this new world is going to strike? Or how do I might decide which applications or services to move, and when? And which of the new service providers (SaaS, IaaS or otherwise) is going to be good and will survive, and which is, and will, not? What are the security implications? What are the new legal implications? How can I set up something now and change my mind in six months and then again in three months and then again three months later, and how do I enable all of this change in a seamless fashion such that the business operation is wholly protected from this rapid change, whilst it is equally able to exploit the upside benefits of that change?</p>

<p>This &quot;<em>Clarity during Constant Transformation</em>&quot; drives a new need, an emerging role of <strong>Trusted Aggregator</strong> - more than an advisor or an analyst, more than an enabler to exploit the rapid innovation in the market - a way of kickstarting Constant Transformation within the corporate or department. The Trusted Aggregator is a group of people, or an organisation, that:</p>

<ul>
<li>has enough insight into a fast developing market to be able to not only spot the services (web2.0, cloud, saas etc.) to adopt</li>
<li>but with enough knowledge and experience to pragmatically drive an implementation of those services in the right transformational way for the business, balancing experimentation with risk and benefit</li>
<li>is comfortable operating in an open collaborative manner, finding a way to meld the individual contribution through the niche specialist through the global corporate into a coherent whole</li>
<li>is able to implement flexibility and agility technically and contractually to enable rapid change and proactivity</li>
<li>is able to act decisively and quickly with impact, enabling the CIO to deliver bottom-line savings and top-line acceleration through real transformational activities.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />The CIO needs somebody who can hedge the bets that he or she needs to make in this fast moving market. Constant Transformation is not just the way of the magazine industry, or just the IT industry. Today, it is the way of the world. It is indeed the New Norm, the New Normal. The Trusted Aggregator will back both VHS and Betamax, will understand both BluRay and HDDVD, will see the opportunities presented by holographic projection and be clear on how to drive the value from it. The Trusted Aggregator will enable and be able to implement a transformational roadmap that must always deliver benefit to the business and to the CIO - now, tomorrow, the next day, next week, next month, next year - and will ensure the inevitable swift changes in direction can be undertaken effectively when part of the overall picture can be done better, more efficiently, faster, or just plain differently.</p>

<p>Adopt, Transform, Collaborate. Constantly.</p>

BODY:
<p>How many reports do your project and programme managers fill out on a weekly basis? How much of their time is taken up preparing the information for those reports, ensuring that the information is consistent and then defending the discrepancies that inevitably creep in whilst they manage the demands of a fast moving project or programme? Oh...and who actually reads them??</p><p>This is a familiar story. I can remember as a project manager having at least 3 different reports for the same project going to 3 separate audiences each asking for slightly different views on progress and each required at different points of a month. It was a nightmare and took up almost a full time resource to manage! Not the best use of time and resources I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree.</p><p>So what can you do about it??</p><p><em>Do establish clear governance... but try to keep it to a manageable level - 100 metrics captured manually are going to complicate the problem your trying to solve!</em></p><p>One of the problems may be that governance of the projects and programmes is unclear and as a result everyone wants to know what&#39;s happening - resulting in report proliferation. Another problem may be that a single report doesn&#39;t cover the breadth of information required by stakeholders of the project or programme. At the outset of the programme define the key metrics, the key performance indicators and make sure that your periodic reporting Proforma captures the relevant information.</p><p><em>This is going to require you to talk to your business users and get their agreement, which should be straight forward as you have already established clear governance...right!</em></p><p>It is also going to require you to be firm and clear, there is no point in going through this exercise if you are going to re-visit it every month. It&#39;s our job as managers to establish the baseline, if we allow ourselves to be pulled from pillar to post then our project managers stand no chance. The establishment of a professional engagement with the business is critical to your reporting process providing the business with the information that it requires and your project and programme managers a target they can hit.</p><p><em>So once you&#39;re clear on who needs which information, (an excellent start!), how and when do they get it?<br /></em><br />A clear communication channel that is published to your stakeholders with an explanation of what the information means (why a field may be red, amber or green for example) is essential to set expectations, so that your programme and project managers aren&#39;t fielding ad-hoc requests for information and or explanations as to what it all means. Obviously you won&#39;t be able to keep the field completely clear, no process is perfect and flexibility needs to be an organisational standard, but by establishing a clear process within your organisation, setting expectations and providing stakeholders with clear and accurate information your project and programme managers can focus on what they really need to do, which is delivering your strategic capabilities!!</p>

BODY:
Organisations are striving to generate more value from their customers. Focus traditionally is on up-sell, high spenders and account management, with KPIs such as product penetration and profit-per-customer being commonplace. But what is really meant by &quot;Value&quot; and how do you create it? Customer management is a well understood activity within our organisations. The technology and tools used to drive it are mature and a level of consolidation and commoditisation is occurring (e.g. Oracle and Salesforce.com). The processes are well established and a reasonable level of maturity is commonplace within most B2C and B2B organisation.<br /><br /><strong>So what next?</strong> How can you drive more value from your customers?<br /><br />The key question is how to generate <em><strong>value</strong></em> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with</span> your customers rather than optimising and simplifying the operations of customer management. Consider these examples:<br /><br />- &#39;gold, silver, bronzing&#39;, your customer base may focus attention - but does it really drive value? <br />- optimising the handling processes makes life easier and cheaper - but can it really create value?<br />- having a nice website may enthrall customers and increase new sales leads - but will it really create value?<br /><br /><p><strong>So what do we mean by &#39;<em>Value</em>&#39;?</strong></p><p></p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p></p>



<p></p><p></p><p>Lowering cost or promoting product is no longer sufficient to drive true value. You need to establish and solve two simultaneous equations:</p><p>

</p>

<br /><span style="color: #ff0000;">Value to the Organisation</span> = Delivering <strong>revenue</strong> and profit <strong>growth,*whilst *lowering the risks</strong> of losing future revenue streams, through exciting and retaining your customers<br />Vs.<br /><span style="color: #ff0000;">Value to the Customer</span> = <strong>minimal contact</strong> to deliver the most <strong>appropriate and fresh product, </strong>at the<strong> right price</strong>, using my <strong>preferred channel</strong> whilst <strong>exceeding my expectations</strong> with every <strong>interaction</strong>.<br /><p>

</p>

EXTENDED BODY:


<p>In a world where substitution is easy, <em><strong>value</strong></em> has to be reciprocal and driven from a customer perspective rather than from that of the organisation:</p><strong>Organisations <em>Value</em> Perception</strong> &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <br /><ul>

<li>Revenue Growth &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </li>

<li>Improve retention &#0160;&#0160; </li>
<li>Simplify and standardise &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </li>
<li>Automate &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </li>
<li>Apply low cost sustainable technologies</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Customers <em>Value</em> Perception</strong></p><ul>

<li>Right product, right time</li>
<li>Solve my requests first time</li>
<li>Exceed my expectations</li>
<li>Make it easy for me</li>
<li>Provide me with the right information at the right time</li>
<li>Be a nice organisation - high CSR</li>
</ul>

<p>To further complicate the picture customers and their habits are changing, the global credit crisis has introduced new regulations and the Internet has created a one-time, systemic shift which has changed the global power game. Around half the world&#39;s people (and therefore your customers) will imminently be connected via the Internet and the pace of connectivity is rising exponentially.</p><br />Recent research by Carl Bate (Chair of the British Computer Societies Futures Committee) states that today&#39;s companies are organisations which at their heart are sensors, collectors, analysers, processors, producers and distributors of information. They are both consumers and producers of information, or information prosumers.<br /><br />Even worse for established organisations, the technology and global information available to customers, in the public domain, tends today to be far cheaper, and far more powerful, than that of our organisations. That the connectivity is driving a &quot;new norm&quot; creating new trends that organisations should be aware of when considering operational improvement:<br /><br />&#0160;&#0160; 1. Everyone and everything is becoming connected<br />&#0160;&#0160; 2. People and machines are becoming inter-dependent<br />&#0160;&#0160; 3. Economies are shifting from being product, to service, to <em><strong>experience oriented</strong></em><br />&#0160;&#0160; 4. Business models are shifting from <em><strong>organisation-centric to people-centric</strong></em>, where the individual, rather than the corporate, has a prime role to &#39;sense, influence, socialise and commercialise&#39;<br /><br />Together, these four trends challenge the very notion of how we interact and mange our customers. But what does the shift toward <strong><em>people-centric</em></strong> business really mean? How will this help drive value <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with</span> and from our customers?<br /><br /><em>To generate <strong>Value</strong> you need to establish an experienced based, people oriented engagement through which you can satisfy the simultaneous organisational and customer value equations.</em><br /><br />So it&#39;s about engagement: When to engage; how to engage; which channel to use; how to create value added experiences; how to &quot;prosume&quot; information; how to allow customers to &quot;prosume&quot; for mutual benefit.<br /><br />My top questions consider would be:<br /><br />&#0160;&#0160; 1. How and when do you interact with your customers?<br />&#0160;&#0160; 2. How can you change or improve the points in the customer engagement cycle to enable more organisational and customer value to be created?<br />&#0160;&#0160; 3. How can you cut down or stop non-value adding interactions?<br />&#0160;&#0160; 4. How can you support and enable your customers become prosumers of information to enrich their experience of your products and services, and contribute to other customers experiences?<br />&#0160;&#0160; 5. How do you determine the correct channels and provide channel agility when facilitating a customer experience?<br />&#0160;&#0160; 6. How do you create innovative experiences to drive stickiness?<br /><br />The world has changed, customer needs are continually shifting, new ways of working are emerging, and driving customer loyalty is increasingly difficult. With the world economies emerging from credit crisis I have witnessed this in action and believe now is the time for us as managers to move our focus from pure cost management through to <em><strong>value</strong></em> generation. Our Shareholders are now looking for us to articulate our route to growth, rather than our approach to maintaining profit margins and protecting cash.

A Radio critic once described Shula Archer&#39;s first husband as someone &#39;so boring he would read Railway Modeller in bed&#39; and this magazine, now celebrating its sixtieth birthday, demonstrates just how long corporate memory is in this unique &#39;community of practice&#39;.































































































































This month they publish a top twenty of the (UK) model railway layouts of all time. What is absolutely gobsmacking is that almost all of the top ten date back to the 1950s, a time long before the current generation was shunting its trucks. </p><p>It is clear from the editorial that this top ten represents a genuine attempt to reflect the communal mulling over at countless exhibitions and enthusiast meets around the country rather that the geriatric memories of one or two aged practitioners.































































































































Each layout&#39;s role in the development of the &#39;craft&#39; is understood. This was the one that first put the railway in the landscape, this was the one that first had &#39;cab control&#39;. What is clear, apart from the fact that Vicars seem to build a lot of model railways, is that the community has an extremely long corporate memory and an appreciably common set of values.

</p><p>Long ago in the 1990s when I worked in Industry we developed a competitor intelligence process with one of the business units in my corporation. It involved customer facing staff globally collecting information from customers, and processes to merge this with news feeds and patents. The results were editorialised to meet the needs of different stakeholders, and kept in searchable green screen technology available globally. The collaboration and teamworking needed was not easy to achieve, but not impossible.































































































































When we tried to get this solution adopted by another business, which shared a lot of technology with the first, we completely failed. Individuals tried to work separately and competitively on the problem, and not together.































































































































</p><p>Pondering why this was, I realised that the first business was in a unit formed after the war in the plastics division. This was about fast changing markets and new technologies, and working together to get the job done (very much a wartime characteristic) was part of the culture. There was only one canteen on the site and everyone ate together.































































































































But the second business was pre war. A much more hierarchical culture and command and control ethos prevailed. Teamworking was not natural, and there were two canteens on the site - one for plant workers and one for management. </p><p>Touching your cap to the works manager when he came in in the morning was still practiced in the 1960s and within living memory.































































































































I was working with these businesses over thirty years after they had been set up. Yet elements of the culture and values had lasted all this time. Clearly - the shadow of the past can be very long indeed, and can radically affect how easy it is to adopt solutions based on new technology, even if it is green screen at the time.

If you are taken to court about an employee who has developed lung disease you need to know whether or not he did work in a particular factory clearing out the lagging 25 years ago.

The challenge is to manage the balance between the formal and informal, and the short and the long term, in a way which allows freedom but still captures, in these times of fast change and turnover, the essential knowledge on which to base future decisions. </p><p>This requires subtle processes and systems which encourage the informal but ensure the appropriate nuggets are captured appropriately.































































































































And as professional records managers will tell you, the growth of technology has made generating a corporate memory more difficult. In the past it took a positive decision to throw records away. Now it is easy to discard an old database on the ground that &#39;no-one has looked at it in the last year&#39;, and futureproofing the information in an old system is rarely part of the business case for a new one.

<p>Mark has spent most of his life helping businesses to get benefits such as shorter time to market, reduced global manufacturing cost and greater business agility from the way they manage information using new technology such as PCs, LANs, e-mail, documuents with pictures, groupware and now web 2.0.

BODY:
No-one in the world could escape the global phenomenon of mobile technologies that have been rolled out over the past 15 years. From the early days of GSM, right the way through to emerging technologies such as WiMax and HSDPA, there can be no doubt that we are all feeling ever more liberated from our office PC. But where is the mobile application space heading, and what challenges does this propose? It is clear that one of the main drivers, and opportunities, is the fact that internet access from mobile devices has become ubiquitous. From IT professionals through to general consumers, we can all use services via the internet from pretty much anywhere. Given this opportunity, how do we exploit this, and avoid some of the past problems associated with mobile applications on these devices?<br /><br />The traditional model for mobile application development held many pitfalls, notably; -<br /><br />- The expense of having to test your code on many different handsets and platforms;<br />- Slightly different implementations of Java and application frameworks;<br />- Differing screen sizes and form factors etc;<br />- Differing input form factors;<br />- Rapidly changing hardware and software market;<br />- Large variations in network availability and quality.&#0160;<br /><br />These all contributed to the high costs involved in rolling out mobile applications. Add to this, issues around security, cost of ownership and management, it became clear some enterprises felt the business benefits where not tangible enough to warrant rolling out these services, even though mobilising data for their workforces could provide benefits.<br /><br /><strong>Why is this landscape changing?</strong><br />

<br />From a simplistic view, technology has just got better. Specifically, mobile communications protocols are geographically more accessible and internet browsers deployed to these devices are now delivering an experience akin to desktop PCs. Indeed, many mobile devices now

 support the OSS Web-Kit frame-work that enables them to take full advantage of Web2.0 applications and services. These devices, importantly, are becoming commoditised and are within the reach of many classes of users whom never before we able to own or operate such units. By deploying applications via the Internet in general, and thus consumed by these new classes of mobile devices, there are clear benefits to be had.<br /><br /><em>One build - One deployment</em><br /><br />By building applications to Web2.0 standards, and delivering them via the internet (or private cloud), you only build and test your solution once. This has significant cost reduction benefits. Additionally, tooling now exists to allow services to be sized/factored for mobile devices, reducing the effort needed to deliver services to a diverse audience. Web interfaces are now becoming more input type agnostic, where both traditional keyboard and touch interfaces can easily operate these services from small form factors.<br /><br /><em>Security</em><br /><br />The traditional model of deploying an application physically to a mobile device made security a major issue. Phones can be lost, stolen or broken into, and how do we counter this? By delivering applications via the Internet, and utilising standards based security models, a great number of the risks involved in mobile applications are greatly reduced. For large enterprises, they may already have implemented further mobile security policies to allow devices to be remotely locked, wiped or access levels revoked. This greatly advances the old model of having your application and data on-device.<br /><br /><em>Flexibility</em><br /><br />Delivery of new functionality, updates and changes are centrally managed, and provide greater flexibility.<br />Management.<br />Keep control of your core application services and infrastructure. This will be part of your overall management programme for your IS services, and removes the need for further outreach support for mobile application support, so again reducing costs.<br /><br /><strong>Future Direction</strong><br /><br />The mobile space as always is moving forwards at breakneck speed. With network coverage and capability becoming available to all, via new classes of mobile devices, it is clear that the days of bespoke applications being written and deployed directly to these devices are starting to decrease. Only where enterprises have specific needs and demands will this model be necessitated to persist. <br /><br />In addition to this, the introduction of &#39;Cloud&#39; services could further the gap between online applications and on-device applications. Where is the mobile space heading? It will move to an always online, universally available medium to allow simple distribution of applications and services to vast numbers of users. This helps leverage existing investment in existing services, and faster time to market. The cloud could provide a good route for delivery of &#39;private&#39; application services and data to enterprise users. <br /><br />So, in conclusion, the mobile devices and applications of yesterday are moving away from the static on-device application and services model. By utilising standards based applications and services, we can start to deliver benefit from Web2.0 directly to these new devices. It is clear that convergence of internet access, security, desktop class browsers and portability will continue to grow apace in the next 10 years, enabling us all to take advantage of these devices and deliver business benefits to our mobile workforce.

The outlined apprach is great. However it does not counter for context aware features, such as locational based content, or "what am I looking at" type of feature. My feeling is that there will always be a place for phone specific development - how do you feel about this?

Simon, you make an interesting point, and I think there are two distinct models developing.  The first, I prescribe above, where mobile applications are delivered as part of your overall web strategy, but secondly, by exploiting such things as application stores, where it is possible to deliver richer functionality to certain devices.

The latter does go back to the 'on-device' model that caused many a issue in the past, but given that the major players in this space (Apple and Google) have deployed toolsets and frameworks that are maturing fast, this could offer a great number of opportunities.  

Context aware information, and augmented reality are gaining significant ground in this space and mobile devices will only accellerate that demand.

Businesses will need to look at how they can exploit these!


Exciting times ahead for all of us!

<p>&quot;Show and Tell&quot; for those of you who have not attended class 5c of a primary school in the last 20 years and whose senior moments are becoming an everyday occurrence, is the opportunity that a seven year old has to &quot;Show&quot; a special item to the rest of the class and &quot;Tell&quot; them a story of particular interest.&#0160; Usually, the more extraordinary the item and far-fetched the story, the more interest will be shown and questions asked to check out if Oscar is telling another porky pie! </p>



<p><br />My son was in tears and agony earlier this year when stung by a jelly fish on the ankle in Sardinia.&#0160; But a week later he was as proud as can be when he rolled up his trouser leg and proudly displayed his purple and yellow scar to rest of the class and declared that he had been stung by a jelly fish.</p>



<p><br />OK, so I hear all the moans in the background &quot;where is this going&quot;, but bear with me this is my first blog and all the children in his class thought it was a really cool story.</p><br />



<p><strong>Insiders vs outsiders</strong></p><br />



<p>If you will, consider all the children to be insiders (inside the school) and all the staff to be outsiders (grown-ups).&#0160; Exclamations of &quot;No way!&quot;, &quot;Did it hurt?&quot;, &quot;What did you do?&quot; and &quot;Will the skin grow back?&quot; were coming from the insiders.&#0160; However, the outsiders had experience and evaluated the story based on many more years in the real world, quickly recognising the story to be true and that the scar would heal.&#0160; The lesson that I took from this, was that if you want someone to quickly and confidently tell you if a story is true and the expected outcome, ask a grown-up - ask an outsider.</p>



<p></p>



<p>I am also used to listening to stories: &quot;The programme is on track.&quot;&#0160; &quot;It is worth spending £3m because of the benefits it will deliver.&quot;&#0160; &quot;Yes, we are confident that all the software will be delivered as designed&quot;.&#0160; But who should I choose to provide me with the Programme Assurance that I need to make sure that I will achieve my desired outcomes?</p>



<p>



</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<br /><strong>What&#39;s your view for Programme Assurance?</strong>



<p><br />This is all about who is best placed to provide Programme Assurance to achieve success - internal or external resource?&#0160; The reality is that despite both sources being ethically sound, honest and demonstrating high levels integrity, there are reasons for choosing an external resource.&#0160; I have listed these below, but would like to know your thoughts on benefits of internal resource or dis-benefits of external resource:</p>



<p><br />- Lack of availability of suitable resource and bandwidth constraints internally</p>



<p>- Lack of specialist knowledge (knowing your scyphomedusae from your hydromedusae)</p>



<p>- Open questions and discussion, unconstrained by organisational / process boundaries</p>



<p>- A guaranteed delivery that demands attention against competing priorities</p>



<p>- Provides gravitas and credibility based on reputation of external resource</p>



<p>- No baggage or history, therefore greater objectivity</p>



<p>- Benchmarked assessment against similar programmes</p>



<p>- Increased competence based on &quot;real world&quot; experiences</p><br />



<p>All these benefits need to be weighed up against the depth of assurance required, complexity and sensitivity of the programme, blending together with the extent of internal and external controls that are already deployed within the programme. However, the overriding contribution made by an outsider is their experience and exposure to different scenarios and events that have impacted on previous programmes. </p>



<p><br /><strong>Swimming with outsiders</strong></p>



<p><br />If you have been swimming in the sea with an onshore wind, you will know that there is a risk that you may get stung by a jellyfish.&#0160;An external resource will have this wider exposure can use this within the context of your programme to make sure you avoid the jellyfish and don&#39;t get stung.&#0160; However, if this fails and the sting needs treating, who are you going to believe when told that you have to urinate on your own ankle - your classmates (insider), or an adult (outsider)?</p>

BODY:
Let me start this by saying &quot;People are lazy, unless they are doing something wrong, then they are inventive, resourceful and dogged!&quot;, but more of that later.<br /><br />The iPhone is possibly one of the most iconic mobile devices of the decade, but while it is an object of desire which has set the mobile phone market alight, it is not the phone on its own which has made it such a success. <br /><br />Yes it is beautiful, ergonomic and performs with the kind of calm aplomb that we now expect from the wizards in California. The always-on internet access was no more than the next step and just as obvious. The radical, &quot;blow me away&quot;, killer feature is the App. Store. The reason why you want to be always connected is the ability to easily grab an application when you need it and pay for it then and there! <br /><br />The economic benefits of supplying software in this way for a large enterprise or government are obvious.<br /><br />Your people have easy, &quot;Self Service&quot; access to approved applications and the purchase and licensing can all be handled automatically. Your staff can become more productive. Yes, you can get that drawing package onto your computer when you suddenly realise you need it at 2am. The cost of supplying that service is reduced as you no longer need 24/7 support staff to perform this function, you no longer have the worry of unlicensed software or worse, something downloaded and unapproved, and best of all you reduce your upfront costs. You no longer have to roll everything out to everyone, just in case. You only pay for what you use, when your people need it, without the complications of per second billing associated with software as a service. <br /><br />So it all sounds like a fantastic idea and indeed the US Government are busily rolling out their own App. Store for their departments, but what has this got to do with IT security? <br /><br />Ironically it is the Apple approval process through which all software must pass before it is allowed onto the App. Store that comes under fire the most. This aspect of the Jobsian App. Store is simply an extension to the Apple philosophy, insisting that every piece of software on an Apple must run perfectly and play nice with every other piece of software. <br />


-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<br />For a Government App. Store this review should extend to security. Thus only those applications which meet a set of minimum security standards and have been tested on the standard corporate build can get into the App. Store. The security benefits are clear: <br /><br />- Only pre-approved applications allowed on the network<br />- Due to ease of use, staff are less tempted to circumvent controls<br />- Strong configuration control<br />- A more stable system<br />- Less chance of importing Trojans or Malware<br />- It is based on positive benefits to staff rather than lockdown and penalties (although these would still be there, but less in evidence - see 2nd bullet point above) <br /><br />The concept of strong configuration control and white listing is nothing new in the security world; however it has always been rigid and inflexible. <br /><br />The other argument against having every application tested and approved is that it is too onerous a task. The counter argument is that Apple are doing something very similar, so yes it can be done in the type of volumes required. <br /><br />Also there are different ways that this can be tackled. In order to get volume discounts the obvious choice would be to have a single HMG App. Store and the UK National Authority for Information Assurance would be the obvious choice to conduct the security testing for this either directly or through the licensed organisations that supply similar services to HMG such as the CTAS labs, CLEFS and CHECK testing companies. However, this would be a large undertaking and like most large government projects could end up taking too long and cost too much, all in the name of getting value for money. <br /><br />An alternative is for each government department to set up their own store.<br /><br />The reason for this is that this way, it is easier to have a single base build and so check that the application will work correctly when installed. Can&#39;t be done? Talk to Apple! <br /><br />The reason why this approach is a winner is because having something &quot;that just works&quot;, which can be self installed with a few mouse clicks at 2am (because the report has to be ready at 9am) and sorts out all the licensing and payment in the background with minimal form filling, increases productivity and user satisfaction in the system. <br /><br />There is no longer any reason to try and download something off the internet or USB stick and try and make it work or to take the data home. <br /><br />Why? Because people are lazy and for once doing the right thing is the easiest thing to do!

In the past collaboration was nice-to-have, predominantly elective and generally unstructured. But now the potential benefits for companies tapping into and helping facilitate their need for a collaborative culture are making it essential.<br /><br />The IT department needs to articulate what&#39;s possible through the tools now available and engage the many stakeholders in the business involved.<br />If you find yourself in this position, the key questions to ask in the dialogue are:<br />Which are the problems looking to be solved by collaboration?<br />What types of collaborative behaviour are needed to address these?<br />Where are we good at it now?<br />What is stopping us doing it better?<br />What is the current state of information, values, trust and IT tools to support the collaborative processes we need?<br />How should we spread success?<br />Who can best articulate the business need and sponsor the activity?<br />Where should we start? <br /><br />Failure to do this and formulate robust answers will result in increased costs, lack of control and annoyed users!<br /><br />An organisation can no longer survive by working by the formal structure alone; efficient working across boundaries is the key to survival. In the current economic climate and with the changing demographics as the populace ages, businesses must do more and become more agile with less resource. We all need assistance to generate new ideas and better ways of working, even Sir Isaac Newton had to stand on the shoulders of giants. <br /><br />For a CEO, collaboration means the reduction of costs and improved relations with customers and suppliers resulting from securely working across boundaries. For IT, collaboration means new powerful tools which are increasingly useable and affordable. These business imperatives of working securely with business partners, moving to a lean and agile organisation and improving innovation are in the CEO&#39;s opinion achievable without a rise in IT expenditure.<br />Very much caught in the middle, in our experience the CIO sees increased pressure from users for more collaboration, but from the CEO the desire to control costs and governance: A tricky balance. <br /><br />It&#39;s essential that a wide-reaching dialogue takes place between IT and the business on how best to align collaborative IT with the business. This dialogue must cover not just IT but also the people, process and information content aspects of what is required. (The fact that even the word &#39;collaboration&#39; means different things in the business and IT world shows how critically important it is that business and IT have a wide bandwidth dialogue about the subject rather than responding in an old fashioned and &#39;contractual&#39; way). <br /><br />There is no &#39;silver bullet&#39; answer to the collaboration challenge. It may consist of using different tools for different requirements in areas such as &#39;what-if&#39; analysis tools to formulate better Business Intelligence, unified communications tools where voice recognition, text and digital dictation can be used to increase flexibility and effectiveness or maybe it is the use of more well established tools within document management to assist with large volume storage and fast retrieval . The business needs to articulate where the end-to-end flow of information across boundaries will add major value, help identify quick hits, and explain where collaboration is already successful.

I think the point of collaboration meaning different things to business and IT is a good one. This is an important barrier which must be crossed in order to even begin the 'collaboration'.

Is your IT pro-actively evolving, using radical evolution, or are you simply defensively recreating through the selfish gene?<br /><br />In talking to a project sponsor on an assignment to identify what he really wanted delivering, his response was a &quot;radical evolutionary approach&quot; to solving his problem. A bit of a conundrum best interpreted as low risk, minimum pain and maximum gain - a civil servant&#39;s view and one that everyone aspires to - a quiet but successful life. Making change can be painful and as with biological evolution difficult to achieve.<br /><br />Evolution is described as &quot;gradual accumulation of change in the genetic material of a population of organisms from one generation to the next that can culminate in the emergence of new species.&quot; &quot;The other major mechanism driving evolution is genetic drift, an independent process that produces [significant radical] random changes&quot;.<br /><br /><strong>The selfish workforce</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong>Adaptation is key, and when you consider that genes are selfish (try to recreate themselves without adaptation) this is a problem organisations also suffer from. People will recreate what they know whether it is appropriate for the current and future environment. How to break this cycle is a major task for CIOs. Staff will hang on to what they know whilst there is a lack of articulated vision or proposition that they can buy in to.<br /><br />Often we as managers aren&#39;t clear ourselves and take up best practice such as ITIL or COBIT as a panacea - on the basis that if we do, we can&#39;t be accused of failing to manage properly. Staff recognise the headlines in the best practices, have previously tried to address them with existing practice and defensively frame the existing practice as compliant. Yet they don&#39;t recognise that the past point solutions that have been created don&#39;t work together as effectively as they should in the full context of delivery. Blindly using best practice as a benchmark can lead to those genes recreating themselves and will not address adaptation to the specific environment.<br /><strong><br />Keep evolving your best practices</strong><br /><br />There needs to be a better approach. Stop regarding these best practices as an answer in themselves and regard them purely as prompts to areas to be addressed as a complete &quot;organism&quot;. Our own environments often have evolved in a piecemeal fashion and we need to disrupt the genetic material - perhaps with a bit of IT genetic engineering to create radical change. This means we have to recognise the &#0160; full value interaction between IT and the business environment and use tools to recast our genetic material, particularly our people to maximise the

<p>Trust has been a word used quite a lot recently. First we had the lack of trust in the global financial system. Now in the UK we have a lack of trust in politicians and their expenses. Stephen M. R. Covey has recently written an excellent book all about it called &#39;<a href="http://www.speedoftrust.com">The Speed of Trust</a> - the one thing that changes everything&#39;.

EXTENDED BODY:

<p><br />In the perfect storm with trust, recent events have also put the spotlight firmly on agility again, and the ability to react to events and more to the point unanticipated events has moved back up the most-pressing chart of the chief officer top ten.</p><p>Agility is one of those wonderful words where one can spend the first part of any conversation simply discussing what it means to the organisation before even getting on to how one might achieve it. Speed to market? Speed of reaction? Foresight? Adaptability? Ability to change the rules of the game yourself? Often in these situations it can be helpful to get the dictionary out, and for the purpose of the post I&#39;d like to go with agility as being &#39;quickness of motion&#39;. But how to achieve it?</p><p><br />In many cultures we have a tendency to convey machine like qualities on our large-scale structures and institutions (the machinery of government, the levers of the organisation, changing up a gear etc) - and agility as a characteristic of an organisation does not escape unscathed from such a mechanistic perspective.</p><p><br />Often, the human aspects that can deliver quickness of motion are placed secondary to the mechanistic aspects. And where agility is concerned the executive agenda will often tend towards focusing on more complex rules for dynamic processes as opposed to human collaboration.</p><p><strong>So where do trust and agility meet?</strong></p><p>There are quite a few formulae for trust. I happen to like the one I came across at Gemini Consulting about 10 years ago which goes along the lines of:<br />Trust = (intimacy * credibility) / risk. This provides a helpful perspective on the mass of trust relationships between businesses and customers, staff in different business units, governments and citizens and of course our social networks.</p><p>If one looks at the social networks of the business - the social-enterprise - in contrast to the typical control organisational view, not only may you discover what&#39;s really going on but you&#39;ll also see the dynamic enterprise trust networks in action. It&#39;s in the enterprise social networks where trust and agility live the most.<br />In unusual situations - times of increased risk - we tend to rely more than ever on the people we know most to get things done. If we want to be agile, engaging networks through the right trust relationships is going to win-out over engaging through the wrong ones.</p><p>But there is a twist here. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_N._Foster">Richard Foster</a> writes in his book &#39;Innovation: The Attacker&#39;s Advantage&#39;, rare indeed is the organisation which relentlessly abandons the products, services and skills that have brought it success. And rarer still the individual. Advantage goes to the new attacker without the legacy. Or to put it in perhaps the most famous way of all - we cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.<br />When we really need to react fast - to have quickness of motion - perhaps it is more in the speed of establishing trust between new people, new networks and new cultures where the agility is really going to come from.</p><p>Perhaps it is in the question - &#39;how can I help the people in my business to form new trust networks?&#39; - where a management focus might lie for agility in the connected age over the more known (and ironically enough, trusted) approaches of looking for agility in the processes.<br />The business case to embrace mass-collaboration - or to borrow a phrase from a new acquaintance yesterday &#39;to unleash Web 2.0 in the enterprise&#39; - is starting to look pretty compelling on a number of fronts, not least of which is a step toward speed of trust.</p>

I find the formula « Trust = (intimacy * credibility) / risk” interesting. I don’t fully agree with it, but definitively I consider it interesting because there are the items, but probably different equation, depending on the nature of the relation.
For example, we can have a high level of trust in the mail, recognized by law (registered mail), but the level of intimacy is not that high.

You've missed the Cylons !

Also regarding Godzilla's technology - his thermo-nuclear breath and laser wielding eyeballs are pretty impressive !

Godzilla also has impeccable Green credentials - not just his skin colour !

BODY:
<p>Its time to look again at your partner relationships.</p><p>Not so many years ago, the scope of a CIOs responsibility was limited to activities that directly influenced the IT department, such as the definition and maintenance of the IT organisation, the associated IT management structure, management of the IT staff and management of the IT infrastructure.</p><br /><p><br /><strong>...and then the world changed !</strong></p><br /><p><br />Accelerated change became the norm as organisations battled with challenges arising from globalisation, new technologies, increased customer demands, increased competition, new legislation and environmental issues. These complex business drivers created new challenges for CIOs in the form of increased demand for IT services from perhaps globally dispersed business units. Delivery of the required services typically involved managing a complex network of suppliers and organisations strived to introduce best practice into their supplier network management. CIOs now needed business management skills to lead and manage a multi-vendor IT landscape and to ensure that the IT strategy and objectives are closely aligned to the business strategy and objectives.&#0160;</p><br /><p><br /><strong>Now the world has changed again!</strong></p><br /><p><br />The era of global information connectivity is affecting all business, governments and society.&#0160;</p><p>Organisations are finding that many of the so-called &#39;best practice&#39; management techniques may no longer represent &#39;best practice&#39; in today&#39;s inter-related and inter-connected world. Established best practices for partner management are no exception.</p><br /><p><br />Traditional supplier management practices often involve a service partner that acts as interface between the organisation and the supplier group. The service partner will often perform a number of roles associated with &#39;the intelligent customer function&#39;, including the following:</p><p>-  Governance 	-  Supplier Management&#0160;<br />-  Strategy, Policy and Standards 	-  Business Assurance&#0160;<br />-  Initiatives Portfolio Management 	-  Contract Administration&#0160;<br />-  Sourcing Strategy 	-  Service Delivery Management&#0160;<br />-  Solution Design Authority 	-  Innovation Scanning&#0160;<br />-  Client Account Management 	 &#0160;</p><br /><br /><p><br />The extent to which the organisation devolves responsibility of the intelligent customer roles to the service partner will depend on the maturity of the relationship and the nature of the business.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Social networking, information sharing and collaboration&#0160;</strong></p><p><strong></strong><br /></p><p>The Web has led to a rapid expansion in the use of social networking, information sharing and collaboration which will lead to a discontinuity in the evolution of supplier management practices. As the the use of online collaboration and real-time information becomes more prevalent, it will become the de-facto means of interaction between an organisation and its supplier group. As the drive for agility and responsiveness from suppliers continues to grow, online collaboration and information sharing will ultimately result in the supplier group assuming the responsibilities of the traditional service partner, resulting in the service partner role becoming redundant in many cases and disappearing from partner management and governance functions.</p><br /><p><br />The traditional partner relationship model involving organisation, service partner and suppliers will transform into a trusted relationship between organisation and suppliers where global connectivity and information sharing will help create an agile organisation with the partner network openly collaborating to quickly provide solutions to address changing business needs without the service partner acting as the &#39;middle man&#39;.</p><br /><p><br /><strong>There will, of course, be a number of issues that you need carefully consider:</strong></p><br /><p><br />-  Can I trust my partners and suppliers with my confidential data?</p><p>-  How do I ensure we retain our business&#39;s intellectual property?</p><p>-  Do my suppliers and partners understand my problem and business sufficiently</p><p>-  What robust but flexible governance structures do we need?</p><br /><p><br />So, will global connectivity and information sharing mean that you need to revisit your partner relationships? Will it help to a CIO to manage a scenario where a shared service is hosted in one country, maintained from another country but used globally? Or will the associated risks be too great for some?</p><br /><p><br /><strong>What should you do?</strong></p><p>The answer is, of course, that it all depends on the size of your organization, the nature of your business and your market, and how risk averse you are. For smaller, dynamic organisations where time-to-market is a key factor in achieving competitive advantage, and governance structures are flexible, the use of social networking and online collaborative environments can be utilised to speed collaborative decision making with supplier organisations. However, for larger, risk averse organisations with more formalized governance structures, such as those that might typically be found in the public sector, the use of social networking and online collaboration may represent too much loss of control be a realistic consideration.</p><br /><p><br />So what to do? I&#39;d recommend a quick review of the following:</p><p>-  The market that you are serving and who your customers are</p><p>-  Who your competitors are, and what needs to be done to achieve or maintain competitive advantage</p><p>-  The governance structures necessary for your organisation</p><p>-  The number of suppliers and the relationships you have with your suppliers - how will these new methods affect this?</p><p>-  How risk averse you are</p><br /><p><br />The answers to these questions will give you a clue as to the feasibility of managing your partners and suppliers using social networking and online collaboration.</p>

BODY:
<p>I remember as a seven year old, I wrote a poem which went along the lines, &quot;I am he, who can be, anything he wants&quot;. I don&#39;t recall a thing of the rest of the poem, but I always remember those first three lines. Of course, at seven I probably hadn&#39;t thought &quot;I want to work as an IT Consultant&quot;, or &quot;I want to be a CIO&quot; or even &quot;I want to be a programmer&quot; (which is what I started out as 14 years later). I was probably still in that &quot;I want to be a Dinosaur&quot;, &quot;I want to be a Fireman&quot; or &quot;I want to be a spaceman&quot; stage.</p>

<p>In the conversations I have with many of the team (direct and virtual), one of the common themes that emerges is often &quot;I want to be a CIO&quot;, which for a consultancy practice that focuses directly on the CIO agenda is an entirely reasonable ambition. For some of us sadly, that spaceman agenda just isn&#39;t going to happen quickly enough! So returning to my poem, if you want to be a CIO, you can be. It is of course up to you to make it happen. If I want to be a CIO, I can be. But what would I do?</p>

<p>The average tenure of the CIO, according to Martin Veitch (editor of CIO Magazine) is around 2 years and 4 months. That gives me 6 months to understand, 12 months to act and do, and 6 months to reap the benefits - and then maybe 4 months to find a new job, before the axe falls or, preferably, for the next opportunities present themselves on the wave of success I&#39;ve created. What would be my themes?</p>

<p><strong><em>Extinction Campaign: Get rid of the Dinosaurs</em></strong></p>

<p>Most IT organisations still have legacy systems, and often legacy people too. Usually these are business critical - the complexity and knowledge trapped within is often too challenging and expensive to easily transition. And yet all systems must eventually die, and all people must eventually retire or adapt. I would need to understand each legacy ecosystem before I selected those to address first (expense of maintenance, criticality to the business, lack of resource, inflexibility) and I would personally start with a mix of both the easier-wins and the biggest challenges - after all its important to get noticed, to be seen to be addressing historical issues that others have

</p>

EXTENDED BODY:
<p> not yet conquered, but its also important to deliver regular improvements. A combined&#0160; approach, with a range of resolution roadmaps, will be fundamental to the extinction and evolution campaign. 

</p><p><strong><em></em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Conquering Risk: Firefighting to Fire Prevention</em></strong> </p>

<p>There are still CIO&#39;s, and certainly IT Directors, whose sole focus is to manage the KPIs around availability and response times - well OK, maybe not quite, but not far off. The time required to fight and extinguish limits the time available to evolve. My focus would therefore be to understand the root causes of the fires, and then to make sure that we managed it at the root - understand the maturity of the infrastructure estate (Infrastructure maturity - <a href="http://tinyurl.com/lt89ww" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/lt89ww</a>), understand the capability and responsibilities of the staff and their knowledge of what to do (Behavioural Risk), understand the rigour of the governance processes (Operational Excellence - <a href="http://tinyurl.com/l65xpa" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/l65xpa</a>) - and get them fit for my purposes - bringing each to the required level. Yes, give everyone their fire blankets still but let&#39;s keep them on the wall.</p>

<p><strong><em>Embrace (the right) Emerging Technologies: To boldly go where no man has gone before</em></strong></p>

<p>There is no point diving into the LMC X-1 Nebula (honest, check it) to find a big black hole squashes you into mush before you&#39;ve had time to think. Similarly I would need to be cognizant of the risks and benefits of new technologies presented to me on a regular basis, before I adopted them wholesale into parts of the business. The nature of my business will clearly also impact that too. It is fine to adopt salesforce.com and EC2 in certain circumstances, but not if I&#39;m in the midst of a life and death business model. Who will I trust though? Where can I gamble? However interesting any of these point solutions maybe, surely there are only three reasons to adopt any of them - so which does it address?</p>

<ol>

<li>This technology (or process) enables me to deliver my business strategy (which would not otherwise be done so) 

</li>
<li>This technology (or process) enables me to deliver the required services much more cost effectively 

</li>
<li>This technology (or process) enables me to accelerate the speed of delivery or response to the business </li>
</ol>

<p>The fourth is clearly &quot;because it&#39;s really really cool technology and I want to play with it to see what it can do&quot;, and whilst we see it time and time again (and trust me I&#39;m tempted - I do like my toys) I just couldn&#39;t afford the time.</p>

<p>I&#39;d work out who to trust (product suppliers, advisors, my team), align the technology adoption to the three core facets and go for it. We want to be CIO <strong>LEADERS</strong> after all, don&#39;t we (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/meubnu" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/meubnu</a>) ?</p>

<p><strong><em>Translate to the Business: &quot;It&#39;s life Jim, but not as we know it&quot;</em></strong></p>

<p>And finally in my role as a Spock, a role-model for my logical, emotionally-detached CIO self, I need to make sure that the business - the captain of the Enterprise - is getting what it needs from the team - every month, every week, every day. We, and others, have often talked about the Business-IT divide and so I will not further here. Suffice it to say that it is my job, as CIO, to be the translator - to ensure that the business strategy, short term through long term, is effectively supported through the exploitation of technology - whether infrastructure and connectivity, applications, processes or people. Increasingly this is changing as the divide is eroded by new generations of employees who are all technology savvy, eroded by global connectivity at a level beyond seen before, eroded by a new mass social consciousness that drives opportunity and threat. At times like these we need Uhuru to navigate through this changing path - what once didn&#39;t work that well will certainly not work in the future. We need to drive the new ways of working, the next practices, the new norm. Take an IT Director from 40 years ago and place them into the CIO role of today and it is a different beast - life, but not as they knew it.</p>

<p>I think I&#39;d make a pretty cool CIO, so would my guys. Of course, I still harbour secret desires to be Vulcan. Apart from the ears, that would be pretty cool too!</p>

<p><strong>Can Family Trees show the way?</strong></p>
<p>Rupert Murdoch of News International recently created his own news by stating that &quot;We intend to charge for all our news websites&quot;.&#0160; In doing this he acknowledged that news funded totally by advertising was not viable and that good quality (and by implication expensive) content justified a premium price from the consumer. </p>
<p></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Extracting fees from users accustomed to free content will not be an easy challenge however. The Financial Times, epitomising high-value content, has succeeded in selling subscriptions to its premium services - reaching 109,000 subscribers in March 2009 compared with 966,000 who have registered for (limited) free content and 435,000 readers of the print edition. &#0160;Eric Schmidt of Google thinks &quot;There will be some very specialised content....which I suspect subscriptions will work for. But for the average news that everybody gets today they would prefer an advertising-supportive model&quot; (<a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/73bc2fe4-45b4-11de-b6c8-00144feabdc0,dwp_uuid=e8477cc4-c820-11db-b0dc-000b5df10621.html?nclick_check=1">FT May 21 2009</a>).</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>So what have family trees got to do with this? Well tracing back one&#39;s family tree involves searching through records - births, marriages, deaths, censuses etc. This used to involve visiting the physical archives but many have now been scanned and digitised - often as a speculative investment by online companies. So finding one&#39;s ancestors involves going to a site and entering one&#39;s surname and other known facts. Back will come details showing that relevant ancestors appear on a census - but that you need to pay to get their details. Most sites have a pay-as-you go option at that point. However the searching process requires a lot of abortive (but chargeable) accesses and at this point it becomes clear that moving over to the subscription model for a period of time is more economic. By this time the client is hooked and the final subtlety is that the subscription model is structured to automatically renew unless the user actively opts out.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This model shows the way for cloud services. The first step is to get users to your site by whatever means. Once there provide some tantalising but incomplete information and then use micropayments to charge for the valued details. Once users are sufficiently engaged to make a lot of micropayments the subscription becomes a straightforward thing to sell.</p>

BODY:
<p>We all know how Amazon changed the game by selling a wider variety of books&#0160;to a wide a wider audience through the Internet, Ryanair changed the game by targetting the low cost flight market when others were focusing on the business market, Gillette changed the game by underpricing razors in order to generate more revenue through razor blade sales and Tata changed the game by developing a low-cost car for the scooter market in India.</p>
<p>These are all examples of Business Model Innovation - innovation in the way that an organisation operates in order to generate revenue.</p>
<p>Business Model Innovation, by definition, is innovation in one or more of the dimensions of the Business Model. This might be innovation in the market served, the product or service provided, the capabilities for providing the product or service or how&#0160;revenue is generated. Of course, for you Business Model experts reading this, this is a very simplistic definition, but it suffices for our purpose here.</p>
<p>Business Model Innovation is by its very nature systemic. Very rarely does it impact only one dimension of the Business Model, and thus only area of the organisation or the IT systems that support it.</p>
<p>Take Tata as an example. Tata, in providing cheap cars to the scooter market, besides innovating the product provided, also innovated the market served&#0160;and the financial model.</p>
<p>The success of the car rested primarily on price point. To ensure success, Tata needed to innovate both aspects of the financial model - the cost model and the revenue model. Vastly reducing the cost of producing the car required new ways of building the car was built, new materials and new ways of working with suppliers. With the profit margin on each car being small, a new revenue model aimed to sell a greater volume of cars at a lower margin and selling cars to the India&#39;s current scooter population had huge market potential.</p>
<p>What we are seeing here is that Business Model Innovation impacts throughout the business. In doing so it will have a bigger hit on&#0160;the core IT systems&#0160;supporting that&#0160;business. For the IT department this could potentially be an enormous challenge.</p>

<p><ins>Why&#0160;are we talking about this now?</ins></p>
<p>Well, two things really. Firstly, technological advances make it easier and quicker to copy products than ever before, leaving a shorter timespan when the first to market can take advantage of their position. Business Model Innovation allows a business to maintain that first to market advantage for longer. It is far more difficult for competitors to dismantle the black box of Business Model Innovation to copy it than it is for them to pull apart a new product to copy it. And often a model depends on a business&#39;s inherent strengths, again making it more difficult for competitors to encroach.</p>
<p>Secondly because there is a shift towards more Open Innovation, where organisations are working together on technological innovations for the future. Open Innovation is driving organisations towards innovation in the Business Model simply because there is so much sharing of information in relation to the technology being developed and the products that might be created from the new technology.</p>

<p><ins>But we&#39;re focusing on cost cutting, not on innovating our business model</ins></p>
<p>A recession is the very time when agile new entrants historically come into markets tearing them to pieces. Recession is the time when people are looking for new ways to do things more efficiently, more cheaply or simply do something different.</p>
<p>Look at the iPod which Apple launched during the US recession of 2001. It was a completely new business model, tying the music player to their online iTunes jukebox. At that time, if they had simply launched a new product then competitors would have quickly launched a cheaper version and its chances of success in the cost concious environment would have been minimal. Their success was due to their ability to change the rules of the game in this growing market.</p>
<p>I totally agree that Business Model Innovation is substantially more difficult for businesses that are well established in a market. Who would want to undertake something that might tear apart what has been the source of profitability for many years? What sort of cannibal would that make you?</p>
<p>It&#39;s a very difficult decision to make, but never the less one that in many cases cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>In the current environment, Business Model Innovation cannot be ignored, and CIOs need to be prepared for the impact that these innovations might have on IT.</p>

BODY:
<p>A growing trend in today&#39;s businesses is the realisation that customer opinion is turning away from large conglomerate and faceless organisations. People don&#39;t want to do business with organisations with distant call-centres -&#0160;and no-one likes having to get through the front-line salespeople to get to the people with the real information. </p>
<p>The same is true for corporate websites and online presence. </p>
<p>Flashy company websites stuffed with sales-heavy rhetoric used to be all the rage and are still must-haves to be taken seriously. But the new behaviours thrown up by Web 2.0 where everyone is a contributor demand another response and present another opportunity for trend-savvy businesspeople. And most importantly, it&#39;s incredibly cheap. </p>
<p>You should consider augmenting your online presence for three main reasons. </p>
<p><strong>1 - Corporate Firefighting</strong>: People are most likely already saying things about your company on the internet - maybe via blogs or forums - and you need to respond or balance the sides.</p>
<p><strong>2 - Appeal to a new demographic / trend:</strong> Generation Y and tech savvy&#0160;customers&#0160;want to be able to see the truth behind the corporate website. A quick Google search always accompanies any new organisations coming on to the radar.</p>
<p><strong>3 -</strong> <strong>Collaboration</strong>: Modern organisations have a duty to provide an opportunity for individuals to showcase themselves. </p>
<p>If the first entry on Google is your website and the next 10 are individuals peddling negative views on you, what is your prospective customer going to think? Try it with some example companies and you will see what I mean (eg Nestle, Esso, - I&#39;m sure you can think of more). And just because its not on the front page of Google doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s no bad news out on the web about your company. </p>
<p>Of course, you can&#39;t police the web. If someone wants to post some negative comments about you that is their right after all. But what you should be doing is assigning someone to be responsible for&#0160;running a small amount of daily checks and responding to comments or proactively creating personal views.</p>

<p>One great example is from&#0160;<a href="http://solo2.abac.com/themole/" rel="nofollow">a website</a>&#0160;concerning TfL refunds which could have easily become a negative article were it not for TfL&#39;s response.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Claim if you are delayed - TEXT YOUR CLAIM</em><br /><em>&#0160;After the debacle over the Central Line closure and the many claims for compensation, Tube Refund.co.uk have come up with a great way of making your claims to the London Underground under the Customer Charter easy. The Customer Charter seems to be little known on the tube. &quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;The London Underground Customer Charter offers a very straightforward refund system for an individual journey delayed more than 15 minutes (except in circumstances outside LU control such as freak weather or security alerts). Claim forms are available at any London Underground station. The refund amount is the standard single fare for the Underground journey you were undertaking.&quot;</em><br /><em>Paul, from London Transport</em></p>
<p><em>Thanks Paul for clearing this point up.</em></p>
<p><em>At present, London Underground receives only one compensation form for every 1,700 passengers that travel.&quot;</em> </p>
<p>Good PR, good&#0160;online presence and most importantly a personal touch. </p>
<p><strong>So what to do?</strong>&#0160;</p>
<p>Start a company blog and make the content as free ranging as you dare. Assign someone who is Web 2 savvy to monitor&#0160;your overall&#0160;online presence, a graduate would be ideal for this. Respond anywhere you can and create, create, create. Finally, find a mechanism to allow your people to pop their heads over the corporate parapet and publish good material where it is clear they are a member of your organisation. This will do your company, your workforce and your online reputation the world of good. </p>

I very much agree with you on this Will, in particular the last paragraph which does a great job of summarizing your thoughts.

I've been saying for a while now that the monolithic corporate website might be fairly effective in meeting the needs of current clients, customers, audiences and stakeholders but does little, if anything, to actually reach out to new audiences. 

Using the whole web as your canvas, where you open multiple windows of opportunity for engagement in the places where people are already participating, takes the conversation to the people - and puts you at the centre of it. 

Two posts that might be of interest -

Hi Will, 

Thanks for this very thoughtful posting. 
I am a journalist. Hence,  I have questions : 

1 - Who are you, are you doing corporate blogs your self ? 

2 - Do you think the corpoate blog should be monitored from inside the corporation or could it be done by somebody from outside,  deeply and openly connected to the corporation, but still physically outside ?   

3 - Many corporations are afraid to open the . Could you give more arguments to convince them to go for a blog and to reassure them ? 

4-  Should the  blog talk directly about the corporation or should it launch discussions of general interest ?   

All te best

Hi Stephane, thanks for your comments, I think you'll certainly be able to write an interesting article on this topic.

In my opinion, blogs have been a key channel to reach clients, prospects and employees for some time now - some organisations still haven't caught up, even though by now there are many ways to implement a blog strategy safely - so there's plenty of reasons to do it, but we find this varies a fair bit between different organisations with different agendas so its best to do a bit of work scoping it first to achieve the right things. We're doing a lot of work with various organisations at the moment about achieving this and also investigating pushing to the next level and creating community sites which allow a greater degree of 2-way communication with customers and the public.

Of course good editorialisation and moderation are essential and are going to become more common roles in companies as their online presence increases, though I think you are right in that many will choose to outsource to specialist moderation companies. We are already seeing this happen in some cases, but others are preferring to keep it in-house for now.

We ourselves have our own moderation and publication system and engage in discussions on other blogs, though its always important to remember the ultimate goal is good content, not just another standard corporate site - so we don't often talk about ourselves its more about opinions and discussions on areas we focus on and have expertise in.

Just on your last point about recommending blogs, even quick research shows that there is no best-in-class that is used by 100% of company bloggers, it does all tend to depend on how much control the company wishes to remain with the central production team or whether to give freedom to anyone to write for the blog. 

I'm especially interested in the brand-jacking phenomenon at the moment which seems to be increasing & is especially prevalent on Twitter (and has been since the start!)with impostors representing real companies...

BODY:
<p>The long running saga of the gap between the business and the IS/IT function has been around for years.&#0160; first remember it topping the charts in the Price Waterhouse Annual Review of IT in the Eighties. It&#39;s still there consistently towards the top of the charts in the Gartner surveys of the Top Ten CIO issues in the current decade. Have we progressed at all over the last three decades?</p>
<p>Consider some of the following statements, do they apply to you?</p>
<p>- &#0160; The customers are unreasonable in their demands, they want everything yesterday, and then they change their minds on the fly?</p>
<p>- &#0160; They don&#39;t understand what&#39;s involved, look at the legacy, and they won&#39;t bite the bullet and invest in renewal?</p>
<p>- &#0160; We are just a cost in the eyes of the business, one that they&#39;d love to offload?</p>
<p>- &#0160; We are only brought in at the last minute when they are considering change, then get the blame delivery is too expensive and slow?</p>
<p>- &#0160; We tell them what the issues are but they don&#39;t want to know?</p>
<p>&#0160;All of the above are symptoms of the business to IT divide, a gap in understanding that until it is closed means it is difficult to make progress. So we in IS/IT are on the defensive all the time and are regarded as a simple hard to justify cost - the elephant in the room! Our response is often to go back to hide behind the technology, our expertise and core skills. To analyse, specify, systematise and formalise everything about how we communicate and interact. Have we addressed the problem - no because the elephant is still in the room and, worse, it&#39;s potentially growing!</p>
<p><strong>Whose responsibility is bridging the gap?</strong></p>
<p>Is the business to blame or are we to blame? Diplomatically, probably history is to blame and we need to break the impasse. It&#39;s a very different world today with clouds, internets, service oriented architectures - hold on we&#39;re off into techie land which turns the business off. These are our problems and as yet not shared with the business. So how do we get them onside? What do we really know about business value as delivered by our organisation to its customers? And, do we really understand the values of the organisation that come into play as it makes those deliveries? I would suggest that we often don&#39;t and, even when we do, they often get lost during the delivery!</p>
<p>Key to resolving the gap is identifying clearly the relationship between the business value streams (the products and services) and the IS/IT services in such a way that business value and business values are explicit. Understand the IT service and development portfolios in terms of business benefit. Not many of us do this properly so decisions about change and priorities, service life-cycles are arbitrary and not transparent to all in the business. </p>
<p>By creating this picture we can start to engage the business on its own terms. If we really want to align the business and IT, we should stop rewarding IS/IT on internal IS/IT measures and base reward on business value delivered as measured by the business. Stop being a slave to cost alone. Merge business change and IS/IT change functions so we are in at the start. Then we have a sporting chance of the business meeting us half way, or better still, allowing the business to take joint responsibility for IS/IT issues and the impact of those issues on themselves. Close the gap by &quot;putting skin in their game&quot; based on business value delivered and demand theirs in your IT game, then the elephant will be ousted!</p>

Steve, I'm interested in your thoughts about the widening or narrowing of the gap. Consider the start of each decade over the past 30 years and for the next 30 years - how did it and will it change? Do you perceive a future where the gap is gone, where changing business models and societal change alters the need for what we perceive as "IT" today? What will be the impact of generational change in the workplace? And how will a trend to commodity and consumable IT alter the dynamic?

Steve, what impact do you feel the recession has had on this gap? Over the past years I had seen CIOs becoming far more business focused, thus starting to bridge that gap. 

However, it is my understanding that the recession and subsequent focus on cost cutting and optimisation has caused the business-focused CIO to turn their attention back to the technology.

Is this what you are seeing?

Replying to Alison - The recession has taken people back to the simple short term equation of IT as a cost at the expense of IT as a deliverer of value - squeeeze the assets which is laudable up to a point as a short term reaction. 

However answering some of Rob's multiple questions, I think that there are likely to be major changes in society worldwide due to climate change, population growth and finite resources such as water and oil over the next 30 years. Changes that will require a fundamental change in social values and systems. The value of IT in supporting these changes could be severely tested. There will always be a need for change as business and social systems evolve plus there will continue to be an innovation gap between technical advances and their implementation. The issue is having a suitable management process that brokers resolution of these gaps.

Generational change has a huge impact on values due to expectation - the young don't see why things cannot be different, whilst the old stage IT managers still have expectations and manage based on their past experience - another this time "human" gap to be managed!

BODY:
<p>It&#39;s coming to something now that even Visual Basic 6 is considered as a legacy - all those little VB Client:Server apps that have grown up in your organisation that are now business critical systems (of course) are now out of date. You can still compile your old VB6 apps under .Net using the -Deprecated compiler switch, <em>but Dahlings, it&#39;s just soooo last century</em>!</p>
<p>So the conundrum - What to do with your Legacy systems now that money&#39;s too tight to mention? There are various strategies for re-invigorating your legacy systems without resorting to a total rewrite. Here&#39;s a selection:</p>
<p><ins>Re-platforming</ins></p>
<p>A useful strategy for addressing those old COBOL systems on unsupportable or niche hardware. The Lift &amp; Shift solution offered by Microfocus and partners is a viable approach. Though one word of caution - it&#39;s no accident that Microfocus have been busy buying most of the Unix/Windows COBOL compilers. There isn&#39;t much competition these days, and it can get expensive with COBOL Application Servers and what have you. There are still alternatives however, most notably Fujitsu NetCOBOL.&#0160; If you&#39;re feeling that your COBOL will be around for a while yet, and you have a desire to be self-sufficient then it may be worth considering OpenCOBOL, an Open Source COBOL preprocessor that generates C code for native compilation. It&#39;s available on Windows Server, Unix/Linux and Mac OS - though relational database support isn&#39;t that easy.</p>
<p></p>
<p><ins>Conversion</ins></p>
<p>This really only makes sense if you use automated tools. There are many suppliers who can help you covering most (formerly) mainstream technologies such as RPG, VB6, Oracle Forms, LINC and Cobol. At the end of a conversion you would end up with a system on a Unix/Linux, or Windows platform, web based front-end and likely using a SQL database of some sort. Some tools and suppliers do a more future-proofed job at conversion than others and often it is unavoidable in order to have a working system, even if somewhat of an odd-ball from a support perspective. You may be left with... </p>

-----
EXTENDED BODY:

<p>an application converted to C#/.Net or Java that feels familiar and comfy to the original support team - meaning old skool sequential style programming -&#0160; but that would be pretty alien to an experienced Object Oriented developer. This could then form the basis for an ongoing Re-Factoring project, but you would no longer have a burning legacy&#0160;platform issue.&#0160; Whilst from a purist point of view some may think this is not a perfect solution, it does have the not inconsiderable benefit of bringing forward and developing current staff at the same time.&#0160; The important thing to avoid is licenced migration software libraries - the gift that keeps on giving to the library vendor! </p>
<p><ins>Install replacement windows</ins></p>
<p>A good thing to do to keep your house warm and extend its life. Older Client:Server applications can generate a much longer useful life by replacing the desktop client end of things with a browser based front end. Vista and Windows 7 seem to be very good at breaking older 16bit client application elements, so stick with the back end systems and their embedded SQL business logic (for now), but address the client end of things. PHP and Ruby On Rails offer very productive tools, and come with a lot of pre-built features to connect back-end logic too - it is likely that with a smaller footprint on the desktop and over the network some performance benefits should be expected.</p>
<p><ins>Give it a REST</ins></p>
<p>As in re-purpose your legacy application for REST architecture - this will make integration significantly easier in the long term, and will also help unlock the benefits of your legacy application. For example re-purpose&#0160;that complex, multi-phase, transaction that updates a large entity to allow CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) stateless operations on a single entity. The benefits of this approach mean that you can easily offer these atomic operations as Tuxedo/CICS transactions, MQ/Tibco/JMS messages, web services, or whatever.</p>
<p>There&#39;s many ways in which you can get more use and/or extend the life of existing systems, and in these cost conscious times you need to ask yourself as a conscientious CIO: </p>
<p>&quot;Are my existing assets being sweated enough, or do I need to give them a swift kick?&quot;</p>

Perhaps a further - and cheap option - is to look at the code and actually see what it is or isn't doing (that is, if you have access to it!). Many legacy apps, probably written many years ago, may be performing inefficiently due to old coding techniques that could do with a good spring clean. Of course in many cases that might be a kind way of saying the apps were just coded badly. Compilers, database access, patterns, best practices, levels of usage, volumes, object libraries etc. have all moved on, yet the code may be gathering dust in the last decade. A good example of this is a recent tweak (20 lines) and re-compile of some vb6 code that improved the creation and formatting of a WORD report from up to 5 minutes to less than 10 seconds. Perhaps it's time to get the duster out of the drawer and shine up all that old code?

Totally agree that code Re-Factoring as part of an overall Applications Mining strategy (once burning platform legacy issues have been addressed).

<p>Guy Lidbetter</p>
<p>I was recently asked to advise on a client&#39;s requests as to how they might leverage the untapped storage potential held within their significant desktop and laptop PC estate. Like all good service side CTOs I immediately identified the potential flaws in the approach.&#0160; The last thing we want is to advise a client to take a path that could prove to be fraught with risks of the loss or security compromise of corporate data.&#0160; We are after all, the &quot;throat to choke&quot;.</p>
<p>Sage advice was therefore despatched regarding the threats to data persistency and security, the risk of local machines being switched off that held the key segment of a file or a laptop not being connected to the network when it needed to be etc. etc.&#0160; From an informed perspective, there is nothing wrong with this given that we have to be mindful when advising in the art of the achievable.</p>
<p>On the face of it the concept of drawing on the distributed sprawl of half empty hard drives naturally tends to the &quot;too hard&quot; pile, especially for people that have been around as long as this author.&#0160; However, the question itself is not without merit. Like so many &quot;left field&quot; ideas, the immediate reaction can be to pour scorn on it but many great innovations have been borne of accidents or ideas that seemed crazy at the time.</p>
<p>To ridicule the apparently ridiculous is not a difficult pastime to enjoy but we risk missing opportunities that come from the 1% that might not be so mad after all.</p>
<p>Instead of asking &quot;Can we do this with our spare PC storage?&quot; to which the answer was of course &quot;No, are you mad?&quot;, what if an open question had been asked - &quot;What could we usefully do with all the spare storage sitting on our PC estate?&quot;.&#0160; The answer, or the thought process at least, may have been different. It is after all significantly under utilised corporate resource.</p>
<p></p>

-----

<p>Based on a scientifically conducted straw poll of 1 CTO laptop, I estimate that an organisation of 5,000 people will have about 250 terabytes of unused storage lying about - not insignificant as an unutilised (but paid for) asset. </p>
<p>History is littered with good ideas that were considered ridiculous but turned out to be revolutionary. Pay attention now ... the world isn&#39;t flat you know, or so popular opinion and a few photos from the upper atmosphere would have us believe.&#0160; Cars can actually go faster than horses without suffocating their occupants.&#0160; Men really did go to the moon in a large tin can guided by an overgrown pocket calculator (apologies to conspiracy theorists).</p>
<p>The then Digital Equipment Corporation made a fine business from attacking the mainframe market with their wizzy new mid range departmental computing platforms in the 1970s and 80s.&#0160; Their chief famously remarked that he could conceive of no circumstance that would require a computer to exist within the home.&#0160; How ironic that DEC were eventually bought by ... a PC manufacturer, Compaq, and now as part of HP, has become part of probably the world&#39;s largest provider to the home computing market.&#0160; One should always be careful about trying to predict the future.</p>
<p>So what&#39;s the moral of the tale?&#0160; Next time someone brings you another crazy idea, perhaps it may not be so crazy after all.&#0160; Instead of &quot;Are you mad?&quot; how about a more challenging &quot;What would it take ... ?&quot;. I once worked for someone who&#39;s favourite question was always &quot;What would have to be true to enable us to achieve this?&quot;. He never questioned the goal, just the parameters that could make it happen. It wasn&#39;t a bad approach.</p>
<p>Now, about all that unused storage sloshing around all over the place ...</p>

BODY:
<p>In the scientific world, it is well known that light can act both as a wave (like waves in a pond) <em>and</em> as a particle (like a thrown rock). The &#39;Double-slit&#39; experiment in physics shows this mystery. Richard Feynman, a famous American physicist, apparently quoted in his lectures: &quot;We choose to examine this phenomenon which is impossible to explain in any classical way, and which has in it the heart of quantum mechanics. In reality, it contains the only mystery.&quot;</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In business and government, the classical ways of management, policy and politics - ways which were developed and matured before the world was connected through information - seem to be of limited use to help leaders in the post-connected world. People often say that the &#39;post-connected world&#39; - the shift we are experiencing in business and society as a result of the Web - is being led by individuals, as opposed to by corporates or government. Individuals are collaborating en masse - doing business, changing politics, connecting with friends and family.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But the foundational aspects of &#39;led by the individual&#39; and &#39;mass collaboration&#39; can often pass one by - specifically what this means for established organisations of business and government. One of the most interesting stories to highlight what &#39;led by people&#39; means, and to highlight some of the considerations for established organisations, comes courtesy of <a href="http://www.franksmilda.nl/" rel="nofollow">Frank Smilda</a> of the Netherlands police.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This is &#39;The Story of the 2 Boys&#39;, and in a way like the experiment with the&#0160;Double-slits, it has in it the heart of what mass-collaboration means.... </p>

-----
EXTENDED BODY:

<p>Frank Smilda researched a number of stories of how &#39;Web 2.0&#39; is affecting policing. One of which is that of a student who had their phone stolen. On reporting the incident at their local police station, the story goes they were politely asked to go home as the police had more important things to do - they had probably simply lost their phone. Despite protesting that they were sure a couple of heavies had bumped into them, the student did as they were asked. Unbeknownst to the thieves, our student&#39;s phone had a piece of software on it called <a href="http://www.shozu.com/portal/index.do" rel="nofollow">ShoZu</a>, which had been configured to automatically post any picture taken onto the owner&#39;s Flickr page.</p>
<p>When they retuned home from the police station, this is <a href="http://www.geenstijl.nl/mt/archieven/2006/11/smile_je_staat_op_geenstijl_2.html" rel="nofollow">what they saw</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Gg4THO-K288/SfHCc-d6-8I/AAAAAAAAABA/Hs1ybJtx-mo/s1600-h/the+two+boys.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Gg4THO-K288/SfHCc-d6-8I/AAAAAAAAABA/Hs1ybJtx-mo/s1600-h/the+two+boys.JPG</a></p>
<p>Frustrated at the lack of support from the authorities, our student posted the story which was picked up by a Web news magazine, who asked their readers if they knew who the two young men were. It wasn&#39;t long before the distinctive feature of the building and men themselves were identified of course.</p>
<p>Soon after, the story goes that the phone was posted through its rightful owner&#39;s letterbox.<br />From a management point of view, this story raises some pretty interesting questions, not least of which are:</p>
<p><em>- Who had designed and implemented the business model, business process and supporting information model and technology to enable the crime to be solved and the phone to be returned?</em></p>
<p><em>- Who had provided the technology to the participants to enable them to share information and work together on goal?</em></p>
<p><em>- What was the business case for this business model, and how had the benefits been realised?</em></p>
<p><em>- And, fundamentally, which organisation(s) had solved the crime and ensured justice was seen to have been served?</em></p>
<p>These questions, are of course, from classical management theory - from &#39;best practices&#39;. They are also clearly out of context. But the point is they are predominately <strong><em>internally</em></strong> focused. With connectivity by default, we need to properly think <strong><em>externally</em></strong> first.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It&#39;s not that internally focused questions such as these are invalid now. They are important still. But that they need to be firmly set in the context of the external. The Story of the 2 Boys shows that while such questions are not without interest, they do not in themselves help understand or provide leadership in connected systems of interaction - i.e. the post-connected world.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The first question, the question to help create the new agenda, is perhaps <strong><em>&#39;what aspects of my business model today are susceptible to people doing it for themselves?&#39;</em></strong>. </p><br />
<p>Perhaps it is in understanding this story, and the associated &#39;next practices&#39; for business and government, where 21<sup>st</sup> century business and societal leadership begins</p>

BODY:
<p>The current recession is causing most organisations to rethink IT expenditure and significantly cut back on costs; for example, the UK government&#39;s <a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/press_40_09.htm">Operational Efficiency Programme</a> requires Departments to save £3.2bn per year in total IT costs in four years time compared to current expenditure, a 20% reduction.&#0160; Yet 2009 also marks the release of the <a>TOGAF</a> 9 framework, a significant milestone in the maturity of enterprise architecture.&#0160; It is therefore pertinent for CIOs to ask whether enterprise architecture is worth investment at present.</p>
<p>But first, let&#39;s define what we mean by enterprise architecture.&#0160; An <em>enterprise</em> is a group of one or more related organisations, departments or units, and could also include the &#39;extended enterprise&#39; of suppliers, partners and customers.&#0160; An <em>enterprise architecture</em> is a formal description of the structure and inter-relationship of components making up the enterprise. &#0160;The enterprise architecture <em>activity</em> is &quot;a means of creating a coherent way of modeling an enterprise to enable the efficient and effective deployment of IT&quot;, according to John Zachman, who originated the concept in the 1980s. </p>
<p>An enterprise architecture includes a set of architectures typically covering business, data, applications and technology, where each is described as a set of component lists, matrices, diagrams and related standards.&#0160; These architectures might have several versions: a current version, a future target version and one or more incremental transitional versions - the scope and level of detail of each will normally vary depending on their relevance to business issues.</p>
<p><font color="navy">So why do enterprise architecture?</font>&#0160; Organisations primarily seek improved IT efficiency, which comes from lower IT procurement, development and maintenance costs through the sharing and re-use of business analysis, data, software and technology products.&#0160; </p>

-----
EXTENDED BODY:

<p>Service levels should be more closely matched to business needs through traceable links from business to technology components. &#0160;Open infrastructure service and communication standards should facilitate more portable and interoperable applications that are easier to upgrade and so more responsive to changing business needs.&#0160; IT governance decisions should be more objective if they are based on an explicit architecture. </p>
<p>Moreover, enterprise architecture should also reduce the risk of major change programmes through more coherent and consistent IT deliverables coming from conformance to common standards. &#0160;Better analysis of strategic change options - such as shared services, mergers and major cost reduction - using linked, traceable architectural components will also reduce risk and accelerate results.</p>
<p>The 1996 Klinger-Cohen Act mandated that US Federal IT programmes must utilise an enterprise architecture framework as part of their IT capital planning and investment control process, so it is now widely used in the US public sector.&#0160; Enterprise architecture has been adopted widely in Europe: for example, by the Department for Work and Pensions and the Ministry of Defence in UK central government; and by Shell, BNP Paribas, Novartis, KLM, Visa, Axa, Aviva, and Yorkshire Water in the private sector.</p>
<p><font color="navy">But why then isn&#39;t enterprise architecture even more widespread?</font>&#0160; Well firstly, the benefits can be hard to understand, harder to cost-justify and even harder to track since they are often only realised in long-term improvements in IT efficiency and in the avoidance of problems in change programmes. &#0160;Enterprise architecture is not normally a &#39;quick win&#39; so it can lack management attention and be vulnerable to cuts in downturns.&#0160; CIOs therefore need to clearly sell the benefits of enterprise architecture, and ensure that they are tracked and regularly realised.</p>
<p>Some enterprise architecture initiatives founder because they become too introverted; they get lost in content, they neglect project and management users, and they fail to express results in language understandable to users.&#0160;&#0160; As a result, they acquire an academic, ivory tower image and became irrelevant to business issues, making them vulnerable to the next round of cost-cutting.&#0160; Architects need to engage with, and stay relevant to the projects that use their architectures and the senior management that make strategic change decisions. They should do this by prioritising their work around the most serious business and IT issues, and planning their deliverables to regularly deliver useful results.</p>
<p>An enterprise architecture is worthless if it is ignored by projects going their own technical way.&#0160; Architects can, in isolation, struggle to assure and enforce architectural compliance when they lack influence and project deadlines are threatened.&#0160; CIOs should therefore establish and integrate architectural governance into their overall IT governance processes so that enforceable compliance decisions can be made that take into account all relevant factors.</p>
<p>Managing the complexity of enterprise architecture whilst still making progress will be a challenge for most organisations.&#0160; Architects will need to select an appropriate architectural framework and customise it rather than inventing their own method.&#0160; They will need to invest in tool support and they should explicitly scope their deliverables to only go to the level of detail needed to resolve business and IT issues.&#0160; They may also decide to partition complex architectures into two or more simpler ones with limited linkages.</p>
<p><font color="navy">What is the future for enterprise architecture?</font>&#0160; Well, the recession will slow the rate of adoption in the short-term as organisations cut discretionary costs. &#0160;However, in the longer term, enterprise architecture will continue to be adopted in large, complex organisations undergoing rapid rate of change, particularly where the following are important:</p>
<ul>
<li>the need to shared data across organisational boundaries; 
<li>service oriented architecture implementation; and 
<li>the increasing competitive importance of business and IT alignment. </li>
</li></li></ul>
<p>TOGAF has acquired so much industry-wide commitment and content in its latest version 9 that it will become the <em>de facto</em> architectural framework standard in the same way as PRINCE2 has in project management, probably leading to the eventual absorption of expensive-to-maintain proprietary architectural approaches like Capgemini&#39;s Integrated Architecture Framework and IBM&#39;s SOMA.</p>
<p>The increasing adoption of Cloud computing business services will continue to move enterprise architecture away from a technical infrastructure architecture focus as infrastructure services become relatively less important.&#0160; Instead enterprise architecture will move towards information systems, and particularly application services, with the steady uptake of service oriented architectures.</p>
<p>The business adoption of popular web 2.0 online collaboration applications like Facebook and Twitter will require information architectures for handling unstructured information held as text, image and audio as well as structured data.&#0160; However enterprise architecture should be able to incorporate these and other likely future challenges to consolidate its position as an important part of corporate IT planning and management. </p>

<p>Transport for London has recently started a trial to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8117567.stm">help sooth passengers</a> as we cram together on the tube and try and remain terribly British about everything on our way to work each day. Tube drivers are quoting the words of Gandhi, Einstein, Jean Paul Sartre and other great thinkers to help introduce some humour to the ups and downs of travelling on the tube.</p><p>&#0160;Last week I had the good fortune to experience the test, and, as well as a pretty decent a cappella rendition of &#39;Bring me Sunshine&#39; - which got the giggles going even with the most stoic in our carriage - we were also treated to the story of underground&#39;s first escalator. This was installed at Earl&#39;s Court and went operational in October 1911.</p><p>However, there was public fear and resistance to this new way of getting up and down, and so to show passengers how safe and easy the new escalators were, the clerk of works for the installation, &#39;Bumper&#39; Harris, was employed to ride the escalator up and down each day to encourage people to use it.&#39;Bumper&#39; had a wooden leg - with the idea being to show just how easy the escalator was to get on and off. Nevertheless, many passengers remained sceptical, believing they in fact knew how Bumper had got the wooden leg in the first place! On the other hand, the newspapers reported that some passengers were breaking their journey at Earl&#39;s Court just to ride the escalator.</p><p>Nearly 100 years on, the fundamentals in bringing change about in any business or societal system remains pretty much the same.</p><p>And it was with high interest that <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6644919.ece">Times recently reported</a> that under a new Conservative government, Google or Microsoft could hold NHS patient data. The thinking is that that Patients will be given the option of moving their medical notes to private companies after the Conservatives said that they would replace &quot;Labour&#39;s centrally determined and unresponsive national IT system&quot;. Predictably, this has raised issues of privacy and security, with MPs and health professionals warning it could hamper doctors&#39; ability to access medical records quickly in an emergency.



</p><p>



 Big &#39;P&#39; politics aside,







 the political, emotional and rational battleground has been drawn for some time on the use of external services over the Web to provide reliable and secure services for mainstream public sector delivery. For the IT industry and specifically its security profession, the cloud and the Software as a Service debate thunders on.
</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>



Whichever side of the debate you are personally on, it seems hard to find a way to convince the other. No matter how many Bumper Harris&#39;s are on display using the new services, the evidence is used to reinforce the already held view.</p><p>There are, however, some trends where there is some consensus, and it is here where we might look to first to find some common ground. Firstly, the world is becoming more and more connected. The UK itself as part of its <a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk/what_we_do/broadcasting/6216.aspx">Digital Britain</a> initiative has recently defined a clear target to increase its citizens on-line from 65% to 80% of the population. Secondly, whichever way anyone looks at it, UK government needs to significantly cut cost in its service delivery. It might simply no longer be able to afford corporate IT delivery models, at least to the same degree as it has over the past decade.</p><p>And so the real question to my mind is, given we&#39;ve had 50 years of experience of gaining trust (in the strengths and weaknesses) or corporate IT service and security, but only 5 years of experience of Web 2.0, how can we gain a majority of trust in the new security models of the Web - and how can we do so quickly?</p><p>In security we place our trust, and we need more consensus on the new security models of default and global connectivity in order to progress. The opportunities are significant. And the risk is that if we do not, the IT professional&#39;s view may well be bypassed.</p>

<p><strong>As if you hadn&#39;t had to answer enough questions already today, I

have some more for you! </strong></p><p>It&#39;s all too easy to neglect the high-level

management of teams when you get into the nitty gritty, but it is a

very important step in survival.

</p>



<p>So, try to answer these honestly and truthfully &amp; answers on a postcard please:

</p>



<p>1: How do you feel about the way your team is working?</p>



<p>2: Are you clear on what all your people are doing with all of their time?</p>



<p>3: Are they part of a tactical project, a strategic programme or key business service?</p>



<p>4: Do you have any way of measuring their success?</p>



<p>5: Are they delivering business benefits, new capabilities or more efficient working?</p>



<p>6: When did you last review/change your people&#0160;strategy?</p>



<p>7: Did&#0160;changing it&#0160;materially affect the day to day delivery of any of the activities above?</p>



<p>8: If it didn&#39;t.....why not?</p>



<p>9: If your people are doing something that doesn&#39;t fall into any of the categories above why are they doing it??</p>





<p>What you can do that allows you to resolve some of the questions above:</p>





<p>1: Catalogue your activities - In order to understand your scope of

activity you need to define the criteria against which they are to be

assessed - Man days, revenue, margin, savings etc. (The criteria should

be aligned with your strategy, latest tactical pronouncement or any

existing key performance indicators against which your organisation

reports or is assessed )</p>



<p>2: Review - Once you&#39;ve got all of your activities catalogued you&#39;ll

need to get a group of your key stakeholders around a table and score

each one against the criteria defined in step 1!</p>



<p>3: Prioritise - Having scored your catalogue against your criteria,

now you need to prioritise your resources against your high scoring

activities, providing your organisation the focus required to deliver

your strategy. Congratulations, you now have a portfolio!! Furthermore

when someone comes up with a new project you&#39;ve got ready made

assessment criterion to score it against!!</p>



<p>Step 4: Report and Re-assess - This is not a once-a-year activity.

In order to track the delivery of your newly categorised Portfolio, the

Governance structure set up in step 2 must review the delivery of the

strategy through a reporting cycle and when (<ins>never &#39;if&#39;!</ins>)

the strategy changes, or you need to move fast in order to implement a

quick tactical change, you need to go through the review and prioritise

activity again.</p>



<p>The implementation of an Enterprise Portfolio will allow you to

answer the questions above and what&#39;s more when the next crisis hits or

the strategy changes, you&#39;ll be able to react quicker and smarter than

the competition!</p>

<p>Rob Price</p>
<p>I have been fascinated by the emerging application of social computing to corporate business. Last month I picked up on two examples of concepts in the Transport space that I particularly like.<a href="http://atosoriginblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0112796dcbfa28a40115711cef6b970c-pi" style="FLOAT: right"></a> </p>
<p>Firstly I met with Headshift (<a href="http://www.headshift.com/" rel="nofollow">www.headshift.com</a>), providers of social computing consultancy and solutions. At the end of 2008, they delivered an information sharing site for British Airways transatlantic passengers (<a href="http://www.metrotwin.com/" rel="nofollow">www.metrotwin.com</a>) that effectively &#39;twinned&#39; places, events and things to do between New York and London - a concept extending Amazon&#39;s, &quot;ah, you&#39;ve bought this, so you&#39;ll like that&quot; idea and relying on their customers to provide, score and maintain the content. </p>
<p>I like it. It reminds me of the magazine on the National Express East Coast train I catch every day, advertising the delights of York, Darlington, Newcastle and Leeds. I love this train for the simple reason it&#39;s got wireless networking available for free. Hundreds of willing online volunteers who could create something similar - commuters flagging the best lunch locations in London, tourists pointing out the best coffee shops or wine bars. I like it. Nice idea.</p>
<p>The second example was the announcement in May by First Capital Connect that they had launched a <a href="http://www.firstcapitalconnect.co.uk/Main.php?sEvent=News&amp;sFileName=News.php&amp;iId=163">Twitter service for telling commuters about late trains</a>. It&#39;s always important to remember that commuters are happy so long as they know what&#39;s happening, and exploiting another channel of automatically pushing personalised information to them makes sense.Of course, to be truly encapsulating the spirit of Web 2.0, the service ought to be extended to collate information posted by their customers too, creating a mash-up of the &quot;approved&quot; and the &quot;public created&quot; content. Surely this would generate additional value, understanding and even empathy amongst the travelling public. </p>

-----
EXTENDED BODY:

<p>I really like the idea, but also knowing the complexity of real time rail information systems and algorithms, recognise that it isn&#39;t necessarily an easy thing to achieve. Importantly though, the real time rail information systems are well established - the information exists - it&#39;s simply a question of: </p>
<p>a)&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; repurposing effectively for the new channel </p>
<p>b)&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; homing in on the question that the commuter is effectively asking and</p>
<p>c)&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; determining what aspects of the mash-up are relevant to answer that question.</p>
<p>Further afield, the Highways Authorities in the Netherlands are already utilising similar Web 2.0 solutions to collate information on traffic delays and accidents from the travelling public. It does present an interesting challenge to the traveller though. I remember a study done around 6 years ago that determined approximately 1% of drivers paid attention (ie. believed and changed their behaviour due to) roadside digital displays concerning road conditions or delays ahead. Advances in the spread and currency of information have improved that significantly. What impact could we expect to see through the display of mashed-up traffic information?</p>
<p>It makes me wonder what other information and knowledge there is hidden in the depths of the legacy systems that we and other IT service providers operate. Perhaps Transport Direct (<a href="http://www.transportdirect.info/" rel="nofollow">www.transportdirect.info</a>): how might that utilise social computing to extend its boundaries of applicability and usefulness? Again through direct real-time information, again through public maintained useful information, but potentially much more.</p>
<p>What about the setting of the football fixtures, our work at the Olympics, our work in Healthcare, our work in Central Government and interestingly in professional service firms such as the Legal business? Each has vast quantities of information and interaction, and ought to be a fertile ground for social computing adoption, albeit a fertile ground with the odd minefield. I hope that this emerging trend inspires some new thinking across our business and the wider industry to adopt and pilot new social customer services sooner rather than later.</p>

I'm trying to work out what's in it for the transport companies to implement any of this stuff.. for all the examples you mention I can't see how they would make any revenue from it. So why else would they do it?

Could it be just for customer service then? I personally can't see it because you'd still be getting the same train whether or not it had wireless and whether or not it had a Twitter account. You might be a little more pleased/less annoyed but it wouldn't change where your money went...

Could it be to encourage advertising revenue then? If you were happier in the morning would you be a little more susceptible to yet another car insurance advert?

I'd love to know your thoughts on this - transport seems to be just as far ahead as any other industry yet the benefits to them are not quite as clear....?

I think the key point here is customer satisfaction. You and I as people who use the trains, the underground, buses and more expect to be told what is happening and why. If my bus is a bit late, I'm happy providing you tell me about it. Studies have been done that look at the perceived passage of time whilst standing at bus stop and it really does show that 3 minutes of waiting and hoping is very different to 3 minutes of waiting knowing that the bus is running 3 minutes late. 

Social technologies, especially supporting the collation of information, provide greater depth to the information experience that we now expect. Think of it as frustration avoidance and therefore happy commuter more than anything else.

But more than that, recognise that the commercial case around the historic collation of some of this information would not have stacked up - and now it can. The opportunities that presents could be interesting - we just need to drive out those with the greatest benefit in driving customer satisfaction and therefore increased ridership, or indeed in driving more efficient operations.

<p><strong>Mark N Jones &gt;&gt; Why does the state get cyber security when we don&#39;t?</strong></p>

<p>The UK government going public on cyber security is unprecedented and a clear signal that the British state sees cyber space as a major area of concern.<a href="http://atosoriginblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0112796dcbfa28a4011570dd9963970c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="MNJ" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0112796dcbfa28a4011570dd9963970c " src="http://atosoriginblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0112796dcbfa28a4011570dd9963970c-800wi" style="margin: 3px;" title="MNJ" /></a></p>

<p>But why? ... Put simply, over the last 10 years the frequency, intensity and impact of cyber attacks on the UK has grown exponentially.</p>

<p>On the 25th of June 2009 the Prime Minister and Lord West (the UK&#39;s newly publicly appointed Minster for Cyber Security) announced the national Cyber Security Strategy. Its objective to increase the levels of both awareness of and protection from ICT enabled threats.</p>

<p>The announcement was made in parallel with public statements concerning the cyber attacks of &#39;other countries&#39;. The statements named the specific &#39;other countries&#39; who are recognised as marshalling attacks against the UK.</p>

<p>Further statements announced that the UK has its own cyber attack capability.</p>

<p>In reality for those amongst the various flavours of the risk management and security community of the UK (InfoSec, Information Risk, Information Assurance professionals) the content of the statements has been a matter of privately acknowledgment for some time.</p><br />

<p><strong>So what does this really mean for UK PLC and the balance of concerns owned by the state and the individual? </strong></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For UK PLC</span></p>

<p>The announcement of the cyber security strategy must signal the end of an all too common covert and complacent attitude toward providing adequate investment into the protection and secure management of corporate information and data... </p>


-----
EXTENDED BODY:


<p>The senior exec attitude of &quot;this is an issue on which we must say the right things but we don&#39;t need to invest&quot; must die. </p>

<p>Cyber security for a company or significant state organisation is now as important if not more important than all others forms of traditional security applied in large organisations combined.</p><br />

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For the state and individuals</span></p>

<p>The UK is in the privileged position of marshalling some of the world&#39;s leading </p>

<p>and most respected assets concerning the security of information BUT, and it is a big BUT, the vast majority of these assets are focused on traditional &#39;high threat club&#39; challenges - &quot;How do we protect the battle plans of our Helmand based military assets from prying eyes?&quot;, &quot;How do we demonstrate that those other countries who attack us in cyber space should expect a counter attack?&quot;. </p>

<p>There is, in my view, far less focus from this community on &quot;How do we ensure that 25 million tax payer records don&#39;t get lost?&quot; because the true impact for the British State of the compromise of the battle plans of our Helmand based military assets is obviously of greater concern to them than the loss of 25 million tax payer records even though the loss of 25 million tax payer records is of considerable interest and indeed concern to the individual.</p>

<p><strong>The real questions are two fold</strong></p>

<p>Firstly &quot;How do we leverage the excellence of expertise present in the teams in GCHQ/CESG and apply it to lower threat environments?&quot; and secondly &quot;How do we redefine the term high threat club?&quot; - for example if the SCADA systems (electronic control systems) which control London&#39;s power grid are successfully attacked and London is blacked out for 2 days is the impact on UK PLC really less important than the disclosure of battle plans in Helmand?</p>

<p>&quot;How do we set the priorities of technology security in a world in which everything is connected?&quot;</p>

<p>Our quest in this cyber age in my view is that Britain needs the best cyber security for us all not just the state and not just the traditional &quot;high threat club&quot;. From your and my home computer, through the fabric and infrastructure of our society, to our battle plans, we need the best protection across the lot. Increasingly we are all woven into the same unifying digital patchwork, a patchwork which unites us and our data whether we like it or not.</p>

BODY:
<p>I had the opportunity recently to do some serious delving into the benefits realisation strategy of a large organisation. It gave me a real insight into how their business managed its project delivery. It was interesting to note that certain all-too-familiar buzzwords and hot topics were frequently mentioned in their business cases:</p><p>&#39;Reducing processing time&#39;,<br />&#39;reduction in back office staff&#39;<br />&#39;a better customer experience&#39;</p><p>Everyone hoped that using terminology from recent corporate messaging would enable a smooth ride for their projects. After I had reviewed several of their business cases which promised a &#39;reduction in back office staff&#39; a quick burst of maths told me that by the time all projects had completed, there would be minus 7 people in the back office!</p><p><br />A few years ago at a mobile telecoms operator, another key buzzword littered their prospective business cases. It was all about churn, churn and more churn. You would think you were in a butter plant for all the talk of churn. Churn is the measurement of how many customers do not renew their mobile contract at the end of their intial period. With high front end costs of attracting new subscribers, operators need to reduce the number of those attracted by rival&#39;s offerings at the end of their initial 12 or 18 months, or those pay-as-you-go customers who decide that having bought the heavily subsidised handset, they will join their new friends on a rival network. Nearly every proposed project had a key proposed benefit of &#39;reducing churn&#39; and as long as this key buzzword was in the business case, proposers were assured that their project would get funding. It wasn&#39;t until belts were being tightened across the company that probing questions such as &#39;so exactly how much will churn be reduced by this project?&#39;. It is this lack of tangible measures of success that dooms many a project.</p><p>In its simplest terms, &#39;Benefits Realisation&#39; can follow any delivery and evaluates the value which has been added to the company (if any!) versus the investment of time, money or resource. It uses proactive forecasting and management to determine the measurement of any financial, operational and/or strategic benefits being realised.</p><p>Despite broad support for IT and being deeply integrated into almost every company activity, senior managers are still questioning if they are getting enough value from their IT investments. CIOs are telling us it is important for them to &#39;want to matter&#39; to the company and not simply be a cost centre. Benefits realisation is a key weapon for the CIO to prove the value of investment in IT systems and the impact of this investment on the bottom line of the business at every stage of projects.</p><p><strong>5 Steps to Make it Work</strong></p><p>Here are a just a few important rules to live by for effective benefit realisation:<br /></p><p><strong>Start </strong>selectively - pilot with a particular business unit or set of initiatives&#0160;<br /><strong>Secure</strong> business co-ownership - Ensure that management collaborate in selecting IT measurements<br /><strong>R</strong><strong>ecalibrate</strong> benefit measures - Regularly review and adjust performance measurements being used<br /><strong>Demand</strong> business accountability for funding and delivering IT results<br /><strong>Be selective</strong> with your benefit realisation metrics- Focus on a select few performance measures and take care not to dilute the need for focus with too many measures</p>

Hi Sukhvir, I liked your article and agree with the points you raise on the subject of benefits realisation. My observation is that although benefits realisation is a good tool for CIOs and CTOs to demonstrate value of the work performmed by their team to the wider organisation, not enough focus is given to tracking the benefits over time to reinforce the message that the projects delivered continue to provide the business benefits stated in the original business case, sometimes long after the project and/or programme has been delivered and closed.

<p>Ask about the future of the desktop and you&#39;ll get some fairly confident responses. &#39;Virtual desktop is the way forward&#39; will be followed by &#39;Skip Vista for Windows 7&#39; and in between nods of agreement will come the subject of Webtops and how huge Cloud Computing will be. Someone will mention that the performance desktop is here to stay and another will insist that security will shape the future. So amidst a barrage of these and other prophecies, what factors are most likely to influence how the desktop presents itself in the future for the business customer?</p>
<p>It&#39;s fair to say that how much one cares about desktop futures depends on where they are right now, whether as a &#39;mere&#39; user or in trying to fulfil a role that involves the desktop arena in their business. Would investing in the forefront of technology be too risky, or is not being prepared a fearful situation that may creep up one day? Perhaps some are confidently adapting now or able to wait and observe - for a while at least. Many will see tighter budgets and witness their desktops ageing, labelled as old and branded the legacy term that is often associated with higher maintenance costs, compatibility issues and shrinking vendor support.</p>
<p>So what areas would affect you?&#0160; If you don&#39;t want to trawl through pages of technology topics, this article provides a snapshot of the key areas that are likely to have a stronger influence on the future of the desktop....</p>

As mobile internet broadband becomes more popular, organisations will begin to turn towards centralised computing whereby employees can have secure access to their data, anywhere, anytime. It is apparent that thin clients such VMware View or Citrix XenDesktop are options through which a significant reduction in desktop total cost of ownership can be realised.

<p><strong>John Lloyd &gt;&gt; Do mainframe applications have a future?</strong></p>
<p>Mainframes are enjoying something of a renaissance. A decline in data communication costs is encouraging more centralisation, e-business transactions are increasing, new third-party software products are arriving. <a href="http://atosoriginblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0112796dcbfa28a40115708fab79970c-pi" style="FLOAT: right"><img alt="John Lloyd" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0112796dcbfa28a40115708fab79970c " src="http://atosoriginblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0112796dcbfa28a40115708fab79970c-800wi" style="MARGIN: 4px" title="John Lloyd" /></a> Size required is reducing and pricing is becoming more attractive. All these factors are leading to this revival in mainframe computing. Organisations are no longer binning their mainframes - why would you if the installed base appears stable and installed processing power is increasing at around 15% p.a.?</p>
<p>Long ago, mid-range servers became the platform of choice for large applications almost everywhere because of their lower acquisition costs and greater local user control. This in turn led to the widespread demise of mainframes, to the chagrin of some and delight of others. However, mainframes clung on in large government and financial services organisations, where they were valued for efficient bulk mixed-workload data processing, very high availability and scalability.</p>
<p>Mid-range servers are recognised as operationally inefficient when used individually for separate applications, causing wasteful proliferation and low utilisation, and requiring more data centre floor space, power and support staff. All important in these cost and carbon aware times.<br /></p>
<p>What is your mainframe applications strategy: renewal or run-down? If your organisation has a mainframe, should you then commission new applications for it or just keep legacy mainframe applications running at minimum cost until its retired? </p>
<p>It can often be unclear whether mainframe or mid-range computing is more cost-effective for larger organisations: the main issues include management perception, costs, skills, technical obsolescence and business responsiveness.</p>
<p></p>

EXTENDED BODY:

<p><br /><a href="http://atosoriginblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0112796dcbfa28a40115705b06df970c-pi" style="FLOAT: right"></a>Management typically perceives mainframe computing as outdated so mainframe applications tend to lack attention, direction and investment - being run for cost-minimisation.&#0160; This degrades application quality as changes are made as cheaply and quickly as possible, documentation is skipped, code control flow becomes more complex and architectural cohesion is lost.&#0160; As a result, application maintenance costs increase as it becomes more difficult and time consuming to apply and adequately test the changes.&#0160; This in itself reinforces management&#39;s perception that mainframe applications are expensive and difficult to change. </p><br />
<p></p>
<p>Processor capacity upgrades, software licensing and staff are normally the most significant mainframe costs.&#0160; Organisations may often spend considerable effort on reducing mainframe usage to delay adding large and expensive increments of processor capacity. The future of the mainframe platform appears technically sound as IBM, with over 90% of the market, is pursuing a policy of mainframe investment and market growth.&#0160; It introduced the latest z10 model last year, it is expanding its mainframe software portfolio - particularly on Linux, and it continues to develop its own mainframe CPU processors - it has introduced cost-effective speciality processors to offload Linux, Java and DB2 processing.&#0160; So there appears to be no technical hardware reason to migrate off mainframes.</p>
<p><br />&#0160;</p>
<p></p>
<p><img alt="Mainframe" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0112796dcbfa28a40115705b06df970c " src="http://atosoriginblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0112796dcbfa28a40115705b06df970c-800wi" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 3px" title="Mainframe" />The mainframe z/Linux operating system could be more cost-effective than z/OS since more recent third-party development software is available and applications can use the cheaper Integrated Facility for Linux (IFL) specialty processor to reduce processing costs.&#0160; However moving legacy applications to z/Linux to reduce costs can be difficult since some software products, such as IMS DB, will not run natively on it and emulation is technically risky. If you are considering new applications in isolation then mid-range would normally appear more cost-effective but there may come a point where the sum of mid-range installed capacity might be more cost-effective on a z/Linux mainframe.&#0160; IBM have recently promoted mainframe application consolidation as a way of reducing costs since they claim that z/Linux becomes more cost-effective over mid-range servers when many hundreds or thousands of mid-range Unix applications with aggregate high processor capacity requirements can be consolidated.</p>
<p><br />&#0160;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The increasing lack of relevant development skills is one of the biggest reasons why older applications ultimately need to be re-developed.&#0160; Mainframe applications are typically written in obsolescent languages like COBOL, using older products such as IMS DB/DC.&#0160; Development skills in these languages and products are becoming increasingly scarce as staff re-skill or retire.&#0160; This will make finding and retaining quality skills increasingly difficult and expensive in an illiquid market dominated by large mainframe users. Whilst training courses are available, it may be difficult to motivate staff to train in obsolescent languages and products. Offshore outsourcing may provide a solution but staff cannot then easily act flexibly as on-site analyst/developers.</p><br />
<p></p>
<p>Probably the most important issue is how responsive mainframe applications are to business needs, particularly when requirements are changing rapidly.&#0160; Responsiveness is a function of many factors including language, tools, products, application architecture, skill levels, staff numbers, development lifecycle approach and environments.&#0160; The first three are most constrained by a mainframe operating system and seriously limit the future of older applications. Redevelopment of such applications under z/Linux, where more modern third-party software is available, might provide a much more responsive application and possibly at lower risk if done incrementally whilst retaining links with legacy components.&#0160; A service oriented architecture approach could alternatively re-use legacy components in a more responsive modern application running on mid-range servers.</p>
<p><br />&#0160;</p>
<p></p>
<p>We recently looked at these issues when we advised a client on the future of a core mainframe-based application.&#0160; The application was so central to their business that they could not afford to neglect its maintenance; remedial investment in restoring the application was needed together with skills replenishment whilst it was incrementally redeveloped.</p>
<p><br />&#0160;</p>
<p>In summary, your mainframe applications strategy - whether renewal or run-down - should consider management perception, costs, skills, technical obsolescence and above all business responsiveness to make the most cost-effective use of your mainframe now and in the future.</p>

What to do about Cobol ?  

There are still billions of lines of Cobol code in production use, estimates vary but somewhere between 60%-80% of the World's financial transactions are processed by Cobol applications.  The avereage age of a Cobol programmer is in the mid 50s - what is the answer ?

John your article has me asking "What is a mainframe" When I first started in Government IT we only knew mainframes and they took up lots of space had loads of peripherals (a 200 meg exchangeable disk drive was about the size of a washing machine). They needed air conditioning and managing them was as much a skill as programming them was. However mainframes got more powerful and the football pitch size rooms we built soon looked very large and we could rationalise several into one location. 
Then came the mini size servers and desktop PC's. You could stick these into local offices and appointed a local staff member to look after them. All seemed a lot cheaper at the time.
So what does that mainframe look like now? Does it still need air conditioning, special staff and a special room?

Miguel: the answer to maintaining all those Cobol systems is a combination of retaining Cobol programmers maybe beyond retirement, offshoring software maintenance, training more programmers, and in time re-developing these systems.

Bruce: a z10 mainframe processor unit has the footprint of about one-and-a-half normal desks and is a little taller than an average man.  However it consumes the equivalent at least seven electric fires in power, generates up to about five time the heat of a room radiator and needs peripheral disk storage units so it still needs to be in data centre with facilities like air conditioning, protected power supplies and a system operator: you won't get one on your desk, yet!

BODY:
<p>The strategy of a beleaguered bank in cash-starved circumstances is a reference point for any recession-hit business. As reported in the Financial Times, <strong>Citigroup</strong>, which has 140,000 people working in IT reckons that it can save $3bn over 3 years by rationalising its operations and systems. In the good times there was apparently no pressure to realise the savings - systems have not been fully integrated from mergers dating as far back&#0160;as 1998.</p>

<p>My&#0160;experience is that rationalisation is not a silver bullet. Whilst there are benefits in reducing recurring costs, the investment to achieve them can be substantial. These costs are not just the capital for new hardware and software but also substantial manpower within IT and the business. Also of course there is&#0160;the impact of the disruption during the transition to consider.</p>

<p>So&#0160;why bother?&#0160;Typically the benefits&#0160;are a mixture of:</p>

<p>- Operational efficiency- simplifying and streamlining business processes<br />- IT application savings- through fewer software licences and fewer applications to support<br />- IT infrastructure savings through higher utilisation and greater flexibility of servers and storage</p>

<p>It is interesting that Citigroup see their project as a 3 year journey. This is not atypical and reflects the complexity of projects and the care needed to avoid business disruption. In the past businesses have often taken stock at this point and decided that the relatively long break-even point coupled with the management effort required were not worthwhile and sought &#39;quick wins&#39; elsewhere. However the increasing competition and pressure on costs from the business downturn have caused people to re-evaluate this - carrying higher unit costs and less efficient processes than more nimble competitors.&#0160;Giving themselves a major and <strong>potentially</strong> <strong>fatal competitive disadvantage</strong>.</p>

<p>As service&#0160;providers,&#0160;we are&#0160;seeing increasing interest in these major consolidation projects - either as service engagements or as part of a longer term outsourcing exercise. Of course outsourcing, or alternatively financing arrangements, enable the earlier crystallisation of benefits.</p>

I was the heretic who voiced the opinion that Oracle may try to 'kill' MySQL; and this thought seemed to be largely discounted.

<P>I just read an InfoWorld blogger on the same subject - the title of this blog is his. He states <em>"One month after Oracle announced its takeover of Sun Microsystems, the future of MySQL remains up in the air.

So far, the prognosis doesn't look good".</em></P><P></P><P></P>

<p><strong>Carl Bate&gt;&gt; Making that next leap in innovation is more</strong> <strong><em>psychologist</em></strong> <strong>than</strong> <strong><em>technologist</em></strong></p>
<p>It is said that Einstein&#39;s genius lay in asking the questions that no-one had either thought - or dared - to ask before. His two breakthrough questions were apparently: &#39;I wonder what things look like when travelling on the end of a beam of light?&#39;, and &#39;I wonder how gravity works when I jump up while<img alt="Carl Bate" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0112796dcbfa28a40115712db25e970b " src="http://atosoriginblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0112796dcbfa28a40115712db25e970b-800wi" style="FLOAT: right" title="Carl Bate" /> travelling in a descending lift?&#39;.<a href="http://atosoriginblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0112796dcbfa28a40115712db25e970b-pi" style="FLOAT: right"></a> </p>
<p>Interesting questions are not just the preserve of scientists of course - Henry Ford famously said &#39;if I&#39;d have asked my customers what they want, they&#39;d have said they wanted a faster horse&#39;.</p>
<p>It is well known that it&#39;s often finding the new question that drives innovation in business and genuine reform in government, not seeking new solutions to existing questions. Some of today&#39;s biggest brand names address questions which hadn&#39;t been asked before - like &#39;how do we get a PC in every home&#39;? and &#39;how do we organise the world&#39;s information?&#39;</p>
<p>The natural language of the new venture is to ask the new question. Mature organisations on the other hand face the innovators dilemma - the paradox of challenging the very question they have spent years addressing that has made the organisation successful to this point. It is this that often drives the mature business or established government to continually seek out new solutions to the same questions they have been grappling with for a long time, rather than to seek out new questions. Innovation becomes a solutions race, not a questions race. Yet the race often switches to the wrong track as the more solutions in a marketplace, the more saturated it gets, and the more it helps perpetuate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift" rel="nofollow">paradigm shift</a> to new competition embracing new markets.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not that solutions by themselves are the wrong things for management to find - rather, it&#39;s a matter of balance of finding new solutions to the existing questions with seeking out the new questions.... </p>

<p>I had the privilege of hosting an innovation session with a number of executives across private and public sectors recently. One of the things that came out in the discussion was how a major pharmaceutical asks &#39;no assumptions&#39; innovation questions to inform its R&amp;D. Imagine for a moment you are thinking of starting a restaurant. Now ask yourself what it might look like with no menus, or no way of taking money.</p>
<p>In this spirit, and in a small attempt to balance the amount of dialogue on innovative solutions, I wanted to share the top 3 questions which came out of the day:<br />- How can we embed &#39;no constraints&#39; innovation?<br />- How can we unleash mass-collaboration across the enterprise?<br />- How can we better understand human systems?</p>
<p>Of the three, I find the last one is the most intriguing. To quote one of the executives at the gathering &#39;we need to dig far deeper into the human related issues of how organisations as well as markets work in order to achieve the next level of innovation&#39;. If I were to guess which type of question might become very hot sooner rather than later, it is this one.</p>

Whilst I think that the notion of a Paradigm Shift is much over used in business I agree with the suggestion that "now" is the time for the human agenda.  (Cars were a Paradigm shift as was electricity - get real business). 

Not since the industrial revolution has there been the potential for such a change in how organisations are structured and run than there is now - largley facilitated by the development of Web 2.0 and in the changing nature of society.  

What really does worry me though is how far organisations are already with this - banning sites such as YouTube, Slideshare and even the magnificant TED.  I mean come on!  If I understand what you suggest re Human Systems (?) sat in the middle of all of this is the HR community, who continue to let themselves down by constant bickering over the definition of thier role.

BODY:
<p>A lot of debate around shared services direction looks like &#39;more of the same but better&#39;. In these unprecedented economic times, is &#39;more of the same&#39; enough? </p>

<p><strong>Low risk, low reward, low potential</strong> </p>

<p>Shared services have been around for more than 15 years and have become a well established part of the cost-cutters toolkit. Some organisations have yet to start, others are developing or are mature and on the lookout for more. </p>

<p>The vast majority of shared service implementations have been in areas where business risk is relatively low and services to be shared relatively generic: HR, accounting, payroll systems. Along the way, ERP products adapted to provide better support for such services. In fact, &#39;shared services&#39; has come to mean &#39;shared back-office non-core services&#39;. </p>

<p>One reason for this narrow scope is the tendency to tackle low risk projects first - and standardised back-office services with mature product support and a body of successful case studies fits this bill. This is a good approach for new starters, but where next for more mature organisations looking for the next level of savings? </p>

<p><strong>Giving up control of your business... or necessary cost management?</strong> </p>

<p>Another reason is similar to that used for outsourcing: you wouldn&#39;t outsource core business just as you wouldn&#39;t move core business to a shared service. But why not? Outsourcing involves a transfer of ownership, hence if core business is outsourced, core business knowledge leaves your organisation. Shared Services are fundamentally about efficient use of resource - no &#39;selling off&#39; of anything is mandated. </p>

<p>Looking beyond the current scope is a step into the dark; the answer is not predetermined. Where do you look when the scope for investigation is &#39;everything&#39;? If you find a &#39;front office&#39; candidate, will the risk of change be too high? Will IT changes be complex and bespoke? In fact, could this just be a costly wild goose chase? </p>

<p><strong>How will you know when its time to take that risk?</strong> </p>

<p>The current economic backdrop is colouring everything. Its not a question of &#39;if&#39;, but &#39;when&#39;. Recessionary pressures are driving the need for order-of-magnitude level savings and will fuel a wider search for new savings into territories beyond the comfort zone of the back-office. </p>

<p>Of course there will be opportunities for future efficiencies with traditional shared services, particularly for new starters, but diminishing for the more mature. Ultimately - the prize of delivering new forms of sharable services will be difficult to ignore. </p>

<p><strong>What would these new sharable services look like?</strong> </p>

<p>This is no longer about selecting a prescribed solution, I&#39;ve got no magic bullet for you. There is a discovery process to be embarked upon which will reveal outcomes particular to your business. Targets will be areas of duplication; over/under utilisation; or where services are required locally but are uneconomic. Some candidates may occur to you now, but you won&#39;t know for sure what the best candidates are until you look thoroughly. </p>

<p>Rethink your approach to shared services - what would you do if the future of your very company depended upon pushing shared services into core areas? Take a holistic view of how your organisation could benefit through sharing and see what you can discover as you may find this increasingly becoming the case! </p>

Andrew, I'm interested in the reverse. If organisations are going to need to find new shared services to reduce costs and gain further efficiencies, then it suggests that the space in which businesses differentiate themselves will be smaller. Greater cost savings through shared commodity implies even greater effort needing to be put into creating positive perception around brand and customer interaction, and the product or service offered. A smaller space to differentiate also implies a shift in the workforce profile to meet the new balance of priorities. Looking into a crystal ball, how might we predict and support these changes from the perspective of the CIO?

<p><strong>Rob Price&gt;&gt; CIO: Business leader or dinosaur?</strong></p>
<p>There have been&#0160;numerous articles written&#0160;on the evolution of the CIO, and a large number that note the transition from Chief Information Officer to Chief Innovation Officer, with a noted increase in&#0160;business orientation. This necessary evolution is brought home by the title of a <a href="http://www.ciocan.ca/">CIO Association of Canada</a> <img alt="Rob Price" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0112796dcbfa28a4011570eea403970b " src="http://atosoriginblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0112796dcbfa28a4011570eea403970b-800wi" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 3px" title="Rob Price" />peer forum themed &quot;CIO 2020: Business Leader or Dinosaur?&quot;. </p>
<p>Of course, we&#39;ve already seen an evolution from IT Operations Director to technology enabled business leader, so the next question must&#0160;concern the impact of a new wave of technology and social change on the position of the CIO, compounded as it is by the changes resulting from a new world corporate order. A PWC partner was quoted as saying, &quot;CIOs are at the vortex of everything that&#39;s happening in the company.&quot;&#0160; </p>
<p>That&#39;s all very well but I think the challenge for the CIO is to ensure that&#0160;rather than&#0160;being the focal point of an internal vortex,&#0160;they are perceived for driving forward business change - both top-line and bottom-line through a more aggressive business exploitation of technological change than perhaps has been seen before. And maybe the space in which we&#39;ll see that most obviously in the next five years is in their ability to drive improved collaboration and communication to drive business change. </p><br />
<p>For me however, this concept of what the &quot;I&quot; in CIO will stand for in the future offers a useful tool to explore those new challenges:</p>
<p><span>
<ul>
<li><span>I</span> is for <strong>Information</strong>: Today more than ever this has to be true. Ubiquitous access, vast quantities of data, the challenge of safe storage, secure access .... </li>
</ul>
</span>
<p></p>
</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:

<br />
<ul>
<li>I &#0160;is for <strong>Identity</strong>: Security will have to operate at a informational level - where is it, who can see it, who can use it, who can interpret it, who can I allow to collaborate with what information </li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I is for <strong>Innovation</strong>: Of course, How do I determine next practices, new ways of working that drive greater efficiencies (cost saving) and greater enabling of realised business benefit - with roots in technology, what are the business, commercial and technical innovations that work for our business? </li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I is for <strong>Intelligence</strong>: How do we drive more value out of the Information that we have within and without the corporate boundary? The question here is &#39;how can I better and more quickly identify pockets of expertise and ability that can deliver more for my business?&#39;. Intelligence will also demand faster access to real time activity across customer and competitor space enabling the business to respond faster. </li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I is for <strong>Instant</strong>: The business demand is now, and technology is moving to align to this faster pace through the disconnection of applications from the desktop. The Cloud has the potential to drive fickle behaviours, shorter commitments - such as changing your home energy supplier. </li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I is for <strong>Impact</strong>: The IT Director role was a back office function of a business. The CIO needs to be front office, driving the success of a business. Through success in all the above, they need to make a strong impact in realising the business results. We are occasionally now seeing the CIO become the CEO, but it is still rare. Intercepting and riding the next technology wave should enable the CIO to be seen even more as business changing. The Entrepreneur is now the technology evangelist, not in the detail, but in its exploitation for big business gain. </li>
</ul>
<p>So returning to the Canadian question, Dinosaur or Business Leader? For me, and despite Carl&#39;s article on <a href="http://atosoriginblog.typepad.com/blog/2009/05/the-death-of-the-it-profession.html">The Death of the IT profession</a>, the answer must inevitably be business leader. The ability to intelligently exploit information, driving instant impact through innovation to accelerate change in business is going to be a catalyst to a different way of working, and to a greater recognition of the play that technology can make. Security and Risk must be at the forefront of this behaviour, emphasising the criticality of identity and assurance in this way of working.</p>
<p>Contrary to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cio">Wikipedia first definition of CIO</a> (Central Intelligence Organisation - the secret police in Zimbabwe), our future CIO is about openness, collaboration and urgency, and yes, about protecting what needs to be protected, but doing so in a logical rather than physical context. The KPIs of the CIO both today and certainly in the future are less about uptime and SLAs and more about a direct correlation of business revenues and market position. In a world where the proportion of industry shared services and commodity use is on the increase, the ability to differentiate business propositions to their clients will be increasingly technology enabled. Again, how we support effective communication and collaboration between corporate, customer and supply chain will be fundamental to the success of the CIO. </p>

An interesting read but the CIO's role will always be more than just revenue focused as indeed is the CEO's.  He/she needs to correlate the IT strategy to a set of defined business goals as driven by the CEO in the company's strategy. 

Typically they would be around top line, bottom line, market share, speed to market, productivity, efficiency, sustainability even CSR and others I haven't thought of. Only then can the KPI's and objectives be set that will enable IT to deliver measurable and demonstrable business impact rather than just being a cost overhead reporting in to the CFO.

I is for Integration 

The next five years is going to be real big for integration. Whatever else a CIO finds themselves doing. About 50% of their time will be spent either planning for or reacting to integration issues.

By 2014 we will see all the systems as online systems, all services on the cloud and all the teams a virtual teams. I.e. the mashups will rule the organization and working out how to manage and integrate them will be the real art of the CIO. 

(speaking as a systems Integration architect ;) )

Guy, of course your point is entirely  correct, and the CIO's role is absolutely to align information and technology to underpin the delivery of the corporate business strategy.

However, I wanted to explicitly highlight the desired endstate whereby IM/IT is directly seen (and perceived / believed / proven) to impact the top line growth of the business in revenue terms. This is seen in a continuation of the shift away from IT being seen as an overhead - as a cost to be minimised - to a fundamental business component in itself. In essence driving the change from IT Director to CIO on the corporate board.

<p>As decision-makers shy away from anything that appears to threaten more risk in an already precarious business situations, is innovation almost becoming a dirty word in the boardroom? In the downturn, should the drive for innovation come from the CEO or from grass roots up? With budgets tighter than ever, how can organisations answer the call to be more innovative and collaborative cheaply and quickly? Innovation is almost becoming a dirty word in the boardroom as decision-makers shy away from anything that appears to threaten more risk in an already precarious situations for business - but it doesn&#39;t have to be this way. Innovation can take many forms and varying levels of risk and reward. </p>
<br />
<p><a href="http://www.mca.org.uk/reports/insight/innovation-protecting-uks-long-term-competitiveness">A recent study my the MCA</a> indicates that short-term survival strategies are killing innovation in all but the most prescient industries and organisations and that executives view the situation as a straight translation: innovation = risk. Despite the government&#39;s ongoing plan to spend through the recession, 80% of consultants surveyed by the MCA believe that the UK&#39;s long-term competitiveness will be scarred by lack of confidence within the private sector preventing a mirroring of the public sector&#39;s spending. How can private organisations make incremental steps to begin to remedy this? Would it be too far fetched to imagine a future where the private sector will lose the war on talent - to forward thinking public organisations with a positive innovation culture? With ever mounting pressure on costs, where can new savings be made?</p>
<br />
<p>Outsourcing your innovation may provide the answer. The MCA report implies that firms with R&amp;D capabilities are beginning to ship the capability out to low cost countries, traditionally used for support and technical functions. It says much about the progress of developing nations that we have reached this stage, but highlights the effect the downturn can have on forcing through initiatives that would previously have been unthinkable. Similarly, organisations are now looking to push some of the responsibility for innovation up and down their supply chains in a wider collaboration network. New ideas, directions and cost efficiencies are some of the rich pickings of this phenomenon, but very few organisations handle this in any more than an ad-hoc manner or even afterthought. How can you formalise this as a process to harvest over and over again and continually find new ways of working with your supplier and customer base?</p>
<br />
<p>Those who figure this out sooner rather than later will be best placed to make it through the downturn and emerge as winners in the new economy. This is of course for organisations which see value in innovation - for those which cannot innovate or see the value, the easiest thing is to abandon it completely, but it is a brave CxO who follows this route.</p>

It's true that those who can best innovate their ways out of a downturn are those who set up innovation programmes before it started. These organisations know what future revenue over what timescale is linked to what R/D costs, and are able respond without accidentally throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

However, this does not mean that those without this forethought are powerless to act. There are many things that can be done: the key is to focus the limited management resource on the ones of highest impact and not get innovation a bad name by some half baked initiatives or a scattergun approach.
Outsourcing can be not just to low cost countries but also up the supply chain to Universities, where increasing numbers of organisations look for their precompetitive work. Modern collaborative tools enable a lot of information exchange, but the old issues of aligning goals and ensuring trust are just as important as ever if the outsourcing is to be successful.

Moving some research to China has also been popular not just for cost reasons, but to get close to the innovation and patents being produced there. One large company said the single best investment it made was in a Chinese speaking patent agent.

How far this is from the timeless 'Yes Minister' where innovation was literally a dirty word: the most damning criticism available to Sir Humphrey was 'A very Innovative Idea, minister.....'

I can't see R&D outsourcing positively when it is not aimed to enhance local team knowledge afterward. Doing research where costs are low is a thing but it must be planned with a feedback to people on the field... How about mastering the last most hype technology in China when a swedish customer asks for it ... ?

BODY:
<p>After the G20 pledge to create a global financial regulator, we
still wait for the description of what this Global Regulation could
look like.
</p>

<p><ins>The problem</ins></p>

<p>The current crisis behaved like a disease. Originally it started due
to poor banking practices in the US but quickly spread through Europe
and Asia identifying underlying problems as it mutated from sub-prime
mortgages to liquidity problems until the whole of the ecosystem was
impacted. Whereas biological diseases are contained through quick
action in quarantining and also providing daily information to the
public this was not a model that the globalised financial markets felt
they could coordinate.
</p>

<p>Its a big risk that the same herd-like attitude that drives the
behaviour of&#0160;financial institutions will lead&#0160;the planners to believe
that a single institution or solution will fix the problems that have
been created. &#39;This is a global problem and so we need a global
solution&#39; is the mantra, but the European Central Bank has shown that
&#39;one size fits all&#39; banking solutions do not work for some parts of
Europe. The Bank of International Settlements is also a single&#0160;global
financial body but its effectiveness in dealing with global regulation
is poor. The time lag between some country adoptions of Basel II has
been about 10 years. A single&#0160;global regulator will need to be much
more active than this -&#0160;and extending this flawed system to wildy
diverse economies shouldn&#39;t be an option.
</p>

<p><ins>So what could such a Global Regulator look like?</ins></p>

<p>A Global Regulator should be a financial version of the World Health
Organisation, - called the World Finance Organisation (WFO) headed up
by someone like George Soros (no armchair general). The heads of the
national banks would report into this organisation and provide monthly
data for analysis. The WFO could issue health warnings as appropriate
at a national level. It would develop tools and processes similar to
Google Flu Trends to identify financial pandemics and even local
clusters of bank failure and fraud.</p>

<p></p>

<p>During financial crises the WFO would be able to provide daily
commentary on the actions countries were taking. The approach taken by
Margaret Chan of the WHO compares favourably with that taken in Europe
and US financial leaders during the current crisis.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Using epidemiological principles and tools we may be able to
identify and contain the next spread of financial infection the same
way that other epidemics have been stopped in their tracks.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Inkpen&gt;&gt;Leaders can delegate responsibility but never accountability...</strong></p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a look at the most common causes of failure and see how much we can point the finger at the leaders - and what we can do about it. Everyone who has ever worked on a project should be able to identify with at least one of these!<img alt="Steve Inkpen_blog" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0112796dcbfa28a401156fcbeb3e970c " src="http://atosoriginblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0112796dcbfa28a401156fcbeb3e970c-800wi" style="FLOAT: right" title="Steve Inkpen_blog" /> </p>

<br />

<p><strong><em>Failure reason #1: &quot;Lack of clear links between the project and the organisation&#39;s key strategic priorities, including agreed measures of success.&quot;</em></strong></p>

<p><span>If&#0160;the leaders would (or could) appropriately articulate their vision of the business changes required (specifically in terms of how the outcomes (in programmes) or outputs (in projects) would satisfy and align with the business objectives), then key stakeholders would buy-in to the proposed business change and see the value in doing their bit to making it happen. Simple.<br /></span></p>

<p><strong><em>Failure reason #2. &quot;Lack of clear senior management and Ministerial (in public sector) ownership and leadership.&quot;</em></strong></p>

<p><span>This reminds me of the old management adage: &quot;You can delegate responsibility but not accountability&quot;. Leaders should not set up the project or programme manager to fail -&#0160;for example,&#0160;by not supporting the project in providing resources, not working smartly at senior stakeholder level, not getting their senior stakeholder support, etc.<br /></span></p>

<p><strong><em>Failure reason #3. &quot;Lack of effective engagement with stakeholders.&quot;</em></strong></p>

<p><span>The number of times projects fail due to a lack of stakeholder (a) identification, (b) analysis, and then (c) engagement are much&#0160;too frequent. Why do leaders not tackle this issue early on in the project? The answers, to name a few, are: lack of appropriate planning, an over-eagerness to get on with delivering stuff, perceived project-board high expectations (e.g. resulting in the focus to be on project deliverables rather than with whom to engage to ensure fit-for-purpose of those deliverables), and so on.<br /></span></p>

<p>Instead of pressurising the project/programme manager into committing to when the first deliverables will be expected, one of the project board members should&#0160;simply ask the question: &quot;Who does the project/programme manager think are the key stakeholders?&quot;, then compare this to the views of the project/programme board.</p>

<p><strong><em>Failure reason #4. &quot;Lack of skills and proven approach to project management and risk management.&quot;</em></strong></p>

<p>Good change leaders make early appointment of the right person at the right time in a given project/programme. This is an area in which much can be written. Suffice to say for now: if leaders are appointing managers of inappropriate quality, then they are just as culpable for project/programme failure as the people they appoint to deliver the goods! In addition, regarding a proven approach to project/programme and risk management, does the sponsorship group have confidence in the organisation&#39;s methodology and past experience to deliver? If not, what will they collectively do about it?</p>

<p><strong><em></em></strong></p>


-----
EXTENDED BODY:


<p>Failure reason #5: &quot;Lack of understanding of, and contact with the supply industry at senior levels in the organisation.&quot; </p>

<p>Again this comes from&#0160;a lack of stakeholder (a) analysis and certainly (b) engagement of leaders at senior levels.&#0160;The project or programme is not a standalone entity; its deliverables need to be integrated into normal business operations.</p>

<p><strong><em>Failure reason #6: &quot;Lack of effective project team integration, between clients, the supplier team and the supply chain.&quot;</em></strong></p>

<p>For me, this is about the way in which the whole team operates in a project or programme. If something is not working, then the relationships should be sufficiently mature enough to escalate an issue and work together to seek a resolution. This is an example of where strong leadership would ensure that there is clarity of scope, roles and responsibilities and regular reporting lines for successful project/programme management.</p>

<p><strong>On a more&#0160;positive note, as I feel I must end on one:</strong> <strong><em>What is to be done about the leadership issue in failing programmes?</em></strong></p>

<p>Obviously, there are some programmes and projects that are not doomed to failure, but these are mainly those that have good, strong leaders involved. It is from these individuals that good leaders can be developed.</p>

<p>Leadership is a complex concept. I am of the belief that although some people may be perceived to be born leaders, they still need to develop, practice and hone their skills, and there is an element of maturity. Whether they are born leaders or whether they are aspiring leaders, they can learn from others who have done it before and have the war stories and scars as proof, and hopefully some &#39;medals&#39; too.</p>

<p>The answer to good leadership&#0160;is not simply receiving appropriate professional training and recognised accreditation, although this provides a sound basis. Mentoring and coaching <strong><em>at all levels</em></strong> of the programme is necessary to ensure that more project and programmes are successful. By &#39;at all levels&#39; I mean starting from the sponsorship group through to the all of those key individuals involved in managing business change. <br /></p>

<p><font size="2">

</font></p><p>Do you have any other reasons for project failure which should or should not be attributed to the leaders? Am I unfairly pointing fingers or does being a leader come with the responsibilty for failure?</p>

<p></p><p></p>

Steve;
Do you think that insisting on re-inventing the wheel contributes to failure? where we focus on improving the business processes instead of implementing successful strategies ?

Ref. 'Fail fast' strategy (Simon posted on 5th June):

Good question - I take this to mean 'quickly make mistakes and then rapidly fix them and move on'. My response is to ideally take this approach when the stakes are not high and therefore the conseqences of failure less expensive, political, etc. There is a need for the environment in which we operate to allow us to continually develop and sometimes this means taking risks, but hopefully these are calculated risks where there are some control mechanisms in place to allow constructive reflection of lessons learned, and not a destructive feedback process where we don't feel confident to take risks again.

Ref. Stuart's posting on 8th June:
Stuart, I think the answer to your question depends on what gets 're-invented', what solution or approach is fit for purpose and what is the criteria for successful implementation. I think I detect from your question that you identify implementing successful strategies with innovation, and I agree with you up to a point. The point at which I start to take a slightly different standpoint is when the pace of implementing new ideas and change can often result in failure, because of the capacity, ability or maturity of the organisation to cope with the innovation/change. 

This is quite a wide-ranging topic in itself, but suffice for now to give an example of where innovated changes over time is a success is in the Olympics. Part of our success to continue to be an IT Partner in the Olympics is down to a need to be risk averse, and implement proven technology. However, we do make small incremental improvements over time.

So to summarise, I believe that a successful strategy can be implemented by making small incremental changes where it is fitting to do so, e.g. in risk adverse environments. However, some environments need to undergo a step-change for success, and the act of implementing a step-change strategy will be a measure of its success.

I have always felt that managing projects and programmes was a bit like Russian roulette, sometimes you just get given "that project". You can have a dozen successes under your belt but if you keep at it long enough you will get the loaded chamber.

Then even when your own tried and tested approaches identify that it is a dud, your boss/the business/ the client does not want to listen.

Ref. Bruce Andrews' posting on 7th July: 
Hi Bruce. Oh yes ... sometimes this can be the poisoned chalice! I have known and managed a number of them. With one programme I remember, the first user group meeting started with one so called team member (although I later discovered that he was actually a contractor masquerading as a client user rep) questioning my credentials for managing such a big programme. Some of the users, in fact all of them so I recall, had back-up projects/programmes running alongside my programme (as the business change was so critical to the business). I must confess that, because of the difficulties I had getting the programme off the ground in the first place, I was quietly pleased when I discovered that gradually, one by one, each of these back-up plans fell by the wayside, while as my programme continued all associated with it became more and more confident and we delivered it, despite some often dire issues encountered. 

I guess when one is faced with such adversity, the only thing to do is remain positive and confident of one’s own ability to deliver something that can be demonstrated to be of tangible benefit, and then make sure that we don’t hold back from proclaiming (at any opportunity) that we got it delivered, despite the desperate situations we were faced with, and then some!

I have published several articles on the topic "why projects fail", and most of the reasons are fairly subjective (each article lists different reasons, with few in common across most articles).

Here's the one that I really like (and most read) on the reasons of project failure <a href="http://www.pmhut.com/why-projects-fail-2">http://www.pmhut.com/why-projects-fail-2</a> , the first reason listed in this list is "Executive Level Non Support". I think the rest of the reasons are equally important.

Hi Thomas,

I must say that I have never considered the notion of overtime being pre-scheduled into the plan. This is very alarming! However, I do realise from your article you are not condoning such an approach. 

Actually, I find myself concurring with many of your points on the reasons why projects fail, particularly regarding a lack of executive level support and improper staffing. My article, in fact (Failing Project or Programme? Should you blame the leader?) makes similar points but from a different perspective. One point that I make in it applies to both executive level support and improper staffing which is that good change leaders make early appointment of the right person at the right time in a given project/programme. However, as I said before, reading your article gives me the impression that we would probably agree on a many aspects of project management approach.

However, before I go, I’d just like to say that I also found other articles on the <a href="http://www.pmhut.com/">http://www.pmhut.com/</a> website a good read.  Thanks. 


Steve

BODY:
<p>Many companies say they believe in innovation as a way to spring out
of a downturn, but few are able to resist the powerful forces which can
grind it down. Budget constraints are all too&#0160;apparent. But in addition
to an inward agenda, inappropriate HR policies and&#0160;myopic management
focus&#0160;combine to produce a climate in which innovations find it hard to
start, get sponsorship and thrive.</p>

<p>As a quick indicator, ask yourself&#0160;these seven holy&#0160;questions to
know how ready&#0160;your business&#0160;is&#0160;in turning innovation into reality:</p>

<p><strong>Alignment horizon</strong><br />
How aligned are the innovation goals&#0160;of&#0160;the people in&#0160;your
organisation, both&#0160;with each other and their colleagues within
collaborative partner organisations?</p>

<p><strong>Insight horizon</strong><br />
How far seeing and how joined up are&#0160;your processes for looking outward
at current and future developments which could impact&#0160;your organisation?</p>

<p><strong>Cultural readiness</strong><br />
Do your&#0160;behaviour and reward systems really&#0160;support innovation?</p>

<p><strong>Partnership horizon</strong><br />
How clear and integrated is&#0160;your strategy for working with partners,
customers, suppliers and technology developers? Are you looking to
collaborate up and down your supply chain?</p>

<p><strong>Collaboration fitness</strong><br />
What is the fitness level of&#0160;your collaboration capability? Is it
struggling on the nursery slopes, or&#0160;slaloming through&#0160;extreme
collaboration?</p>

<p><strong>IT capability</strong><br />
Does&#0160;your IT enable or constrain the way you need to work?</p>

<p><strong>Process subtlety</strong><br />
Can business processes support these apparent contradictions in flexibility and conformance needed to encourage more innovation?
</p>

<p>It is&#0160;vital to&#0160;identify where those inevitable pressures of the
short-term are having an impact on&#0160;your innovation capability, so that
you&#0160;can focus enough precious management resource to keep
your&#0160;innovative projects&#0160;alive.</p>

<p>Using these seven indicators&#0160;to form the basis of your&#0160;business
model&#0160;will dramatically increase your&#0160;ability to&#0160;innovate and incubate,
help you to develop a true innovative culture and avoid the trap of
talking innovation and never acting.</p>

Mark, I'm interested to know how, based on understanding of where any organisation fits on an innovation maturity assessment, you approach raising them higher up that maturity model. More importantly, when there is a commonly expressed perception that ALL organisations should be more innovative, how you would approach determining whether any particular maturity level is deemed to be too low, too high or just about right?

If there was one thing that an organisation should be doing differently tomorrow, in your recommendation, what would it be?

Good question. Answering the last part first, I would first look at the levels of innovation across the wider industry or environment the organisation is in, since innovation levels largely relate to industry maturity. I would then identify with the organisation those 'maturity levels' in the model where differentiation would bring most advantage or value as part of or enhancing the competitive model of the business. If this results in an area where enhanced innovation would link to competitive (or for a government organisation) performance advantages, it should be possible to identify an in place sponsor who can help in raising the level up.

<p>Danyel Ceccaldi and Simon Elliott from the Atos Origin CTO attended the Amazon Web Services startup event in the wonderful British Museum, for a five hour cloud computing festival of puns.&#0160;You IT and Computer professionals out there better watch out, your land is about to be invaded ... by the Amazonians.</p>
<p>Here are some of the shocking attempts at humour that&#0160;we brought back:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seeing through the fog 
<li>Where do you go after the Planet ... the Cloud 
<li>There are storms ahead 
<li>The Sky is the limit 
<li>You&#39;ve got Clouded vision 
<li>Flying through the Clouds </li>
</li></li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>Amazon gathered a mixed community of entrepreneurs, geeks, ISVs, and consultancies to their event titled <strong>START UP</strong>. The event was both Amazon advertising its platform, and also demonstrating a milestone in development and delivery of their third operation - <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" rel="nofollow">Amazon Web Services</a>, after they have already impressed customers and shareholders with their B2C retail and B2B fulfilment lines of business.</p>
<p>The event was excellent, well run, great content and good bunch to network with. And because there was no alcohol no one made chumps of themselves. What Amazon has done, and truly amazes us, is hooking-up everything you need to make a media product: the existing Amazon marketplace and the sales tools needed to derive revenue from it. What&#39;s more they have codified all the processes necessary to make it happen. There was an interesting audience made up of around 1,000 in total.</p>
<p>I counted down my row and worked out these percentages.</p>
<ul>
<li>30% Suits 
<li>30% Business casual 
<li>10% Casual 
<li>2% Female 
<li>3% Shaved heads 
<li>5% Flamboyant media types<br />(You can figure out which of these categories Simon and Danyell fit into!) </li>
</li></li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>AWS is a growing cloud ecosystem, with some solid and property-rich fundamental platform services. Amazon is convinced that AWS is not just a hobby of Mr. Bezos, but is a high profile line of business, ranking at the same level of strategy as their $15 billion retail operation. Essentially, businesses can hire AWS ecosystem resources by the hour, starting with $0.10 for one hour compute time. Everything is self-service and almost as easy as buying a book online. However it is a young ecosystem, and as with every ecosystem you find contributions from many other parties to make it viable for customer needs. This includes information technology providers like ourselves at&#0160;Atos Origin. With AWS&#39;s youth comes risk. Maturity has to grow, so it is no surprise that some partnerships are not yet finally set. The more you look up into the stack of technology and into business need delivery, the lighter the offerings are.</p>
<p>As with many new technologies the Amazon cloud at present may be easy to use for new developments, yet legacy might be more costly to deploy. It was stated that engineers must be used to transform constraints into workarounds. One of these constraints is to design for failure, as ultimately everything can fail. The lightweight and customer focused offerings adopt this approach. This is a change from how traditional data centres operate, which is to eventually buy yourself out of the constraint with big and costly, but powerful and resilient, tin. Ultimately the ecosystem will provide some workarounds to buy.</p>
<p>A common experience when trying to make or launch something new is the dreaded and endless conversations with the operational team (usually Luddites more resistant to change than a glacier) to persuade them to commission a new box or worse still ... change an old one. Well, Amazon have really thought about this, and have provided both a web UI and an API to do it. This means that you can get development code into production faster, and If you can do that ... it means that you can either demonstrate that an innovation fails or derive revenue from it with a smaller expense (i.e. your precious time).</p>
<p>We do have a concern that this inevitable migration to large cloud providers will ultimately create an even larger dependency on a shrinking set of suppliers. In the end this is anti-consumer, maybe its time for a state run or even UN-owned cloud?</p>
<p>Another interesting observation was how Amazon lead their story, not with the usual faster, better, look how wonderful this is sort of speel. They instead lead with a single number 99.95%, which is their availability for their general release elastic compute cloud. In fact the keynote speaker included just this number on the screen as his second slide.</p>
<p>To us, Amazon Web Services and its competitors in the rearview mirror represent an opportunity for high business volumes in the years to come, because many businesses will eventually realize the benefits of cloud computing. Check out <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" rel="nofollow">http://aws.amazon.com</a> for more on Amazon Web Services, and <a href="http://atosorigin.com/" rel="nofollow">http://atosorigin.com</a> for our full spectrum of information technology services, making a good team to facilitate technology in the interest of business.</p>
<p>For the geeks - In the AWS ecosystem you find virtualized x86_64 computing architecture in at least three sizes of tin, running Windows, Solaris, Linux - some featured platform services include SQL Server, IBM and Oracle middleware products, some Amazon middleware services for queuing, content distribution, IP services, and more, and different Amazon offerings for the hosting of data.</p>
<p>Note:<br />For those of you who are into sustainability, when someone asked the question &quot;Will Amazon be using renewable energy sources for its servers&quot; there was a big laugh and a stumped speaker, so we&#39;re guessing not!</p>

<p><strong>Alison Booth&gt;&gt;The reality of a fully-fledged Semantic Web just seems beyond reach</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;ve been following the Semantic Web for a number of years now. The vision portrays an intelligent Web that understands meaning and can further infer new knowledge.<img alt="Alison" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0112796dcbfa28a4011570a9c63c970b " src="http://atosoriginblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0112796dcbfa28a4011570a9c63c970b-800wi" style="FLOAT: right" title="Alison" /></p>

<p>The Semantic Web aims to build on today&#39;s Web by giving applications the ability to find the meaning of <a href="http://atosoriginblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0112796dcbfa28a4011570a9c63c970b-pi" style="FLOAT: right"></a>a piece of information and how it related to other pieces of information. Using well-defined rules and logic, intelligent applications and agents will be able to infer further information from these linked pieces of information, thus mining knowledge. They will have to be able to prove their findings when required, using a trust framework to establish the validity of information.</p>
<p>It would be able to differentiate between Turkey and a turkey, to understand that&#0160;two people are related if they are father and son and that&#0160;Brighton is in East Sussex... or do you mean the &#39;Brighton&#39; in Tasmania, Ontario, Illinois, Michigan, Iowa,...?</p>
<p><strong>So why is it so important?</strong></p>
<p>The vision portrays the Semantic Web as dramatically changing business&#39;s ability to turn their information into knowledge by enabling information from many diverse sources, including Web pages, databases and legacy systems, to be brought together and mined, producing further, deeper inferred knowledge. There would be applications for it in data integration, information searching, content management, customer relationship management, business activity monitoring and much more. Beyond information, the Semantic Web would also enable services to be advertised, found and made use of automatically.</p>
<p>Consider the following scenario as an example...</p>
<p>
</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:

<p>Like most companies and most individuals, both Jane and her insurance company use intelligent software agents to carry out mundane tasks. These agents are able to work together over the Semantic Web, negotiating between them in order to fulfil their individual objectives. They are autonomous software entities that are able to work asynchronously, each optimised for a specific purpose. The Semantic Web provides them with meaningful information, from which they can infer the knowledge they need in order to carry out their tasks.</p>
<p>One of the insurance company&#39;s intelligent software agents is allocated to manage the claim that Jane&#39;s personal virtual assistant agent has just submitted on her behalf. The insurance agent proactively ensures it is validated. It sends the relevant information to various fraud agencies, using the Semantic Web to ensure the consistent meaning of terms, and on receiving positive feedback, the agent approves her claim.<br />The agent next starts negotiations with the third party&#39;s insurance company&#39;s agent. The Semantic Web enables this machine-2-machine interaction to take place, ensuring that each term that is discussed in the negotiations is understood both agents to mean the same thing. For example driver, passenger, address, bumper, dent, ... are just some of the terms that would not only need to be understood. And not just understood - the agents need to understand how these terms relate to each other in order to infer further knowledge - the driver drives the car. Address is a location where someone lives...</p>
<p>Overnight, the insurance agent works with Jane&#39;s own personal agent, and an agent from the insurance company&#39;s approved repairers to book the car in for repairs. Using the Semantic Web, the diary and location information from Jane&#39;s personal agent, and a work schedule from the body shop, they are able to work together to negotiate several possible dates. The Semantic Web would enable the agents to communicate in the same language, ensuring that each understands the meaning of any term discussed and how it relates to other things. Additionally it would enable the agents to infer possible dates from the diary and work schedule through their understanding of the meaning of events in each and the implication of what each event entails.<br />In the morning, Jane&#39;s personal agent gives her three different options for repair dates, but Jane is not happy with any of the solutions - the body shop does not use original manufacturer&#39;s parts. Jane sets her agent on its way again. Using a Semantic Search, the agent is able to quickly find an alternative suitable, local body shop ...<br />.... and the story continues.</p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
<p>Without going deeply technical, the Semantic Web makes use of ontologies to provide this functionality. An ontology is a machine readable definition of an object and how it relates to other objects that can be used to infer further knowledge. For example, an ontology about fathers could define fathers as men with children. Another ontology about George could say that George is a man and that George has two children. From this, an intelligent application or agent could infer that George is a father.</p>
<p>Thus, in order for it to be successful, the Semantic Web would needs vast amounts of&#0160;information telling it about objects and how they relate to each other.</p>
<p><strong>Not enough information?</strong></p>
<p>The problem today is that there just isn&#39;t enough of this information available for it to work well enough. A bit of a chicken and egg really - you won&#39;t see it&#39;s full potential until enough information is available, but less focus will go into generating the information if the rewards cannot be seen.</p>
<p>What we have at the moment is akin to inventing a new vehicle, but having no&#0160;sensible way of creating the fuel needed to run it. The concept is great, but the means of generating and maintaining the information required is flawed.</p>
<p><strong>How about generating it automatically</strong></p>
<p>The only way forward, as far as I can see, is for the ontologies to be&#0160;generated automatically. Could Wikipedia and online dictionaries be turned into ontologies?</p>
<p>Still this would not be sufficient. Not only is our&#0160;language very complex and ever changing, but dictionaries and wikis describes objects well, but not the relationships between them.</p>
<p>We are&#0160;simply not in a position to create all of the information that is needed - automatically or otherwise - and keep it up to date. And who is to stop duplication or who would say which version is right or wrong?</p>
<p>The reality of a fully fledged Semantic Web just seems beyond reach.</p>
<p><strong>What for the future?</strong></p>
<p>It is my belief that the Semantic Web needs to evolve into something very different if it&#0160;is to become a reality. These changes may well be so&#0160;radical that&#0160;they&#0160;take the Semantic Web to a place that is&#0160;far from the original vision.</p>
<p>I do believe that something will come out of this - but exactly what remains to be seen..... </p>

The strength of a tribe comes from the connection of the tribe members to the tribe leader, and the members&#39; ability to interact with each other.&#0160; (This is why, once-upon-a time, in the pre-digital age, tribes were based around geography. The hunters who hunted out of the same longhouse were a tribe.

Great article Greg, 

What's really interesting is just how quickly this new concept has been adopted and gone mainstream. 

If you look at this from a new media perspective .. twitter as a product is competing against other communications or publishing formats. 

The technology of twitter is far far simpler than any of its contemporaries. And more importantly this simplicity is reflected in its user interface. 

Combine this simplicity (product design magic) with some nuskool words (tweeting, microblogging) and you have a marketing sensation,

This gave twitter a faster rate of propagation across social networks. 

Whether or not twitter is waste of time ... only time will tell. What is defiantly not a waste of time is the method by which this product has been brought to the world. We can expect to see smart designers doing this again and again.

<p><strong>Bite size chunks, a wider menu, timely delivery - but the rules remain the same</strong></p>
<p>There is nothing new about the outsourcing of problem solving to third parties. What is new is the speed of the process and the small size and variety of the problems which can be outsourced.</p>
<p>For example, large companies manage their university partnerships carefully. They work generally with those who have an established position in a chosen area of expertise and who also have a track record of delivering projects on time and in full. But often this involves sponsoring a three year PhD project which means 4 years before the problem is solved.</p>
<p>The accelerating pace of change means that problem solving over much shorter timescale is vital, but the same general questions apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can I trust the other party with my confidential data? 
<li>Will the solution meet my requirements, both specified and implicit? 
<li>Can I pay extra to retain the intellectual property of the solution? 
<li>Does the other party understand my problem and business sufficiently? 
<li>Do we have internally the processes for sharing the solution and maximizing our value from it? </li>
</li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>In the technical domain, companies who broker the relationship between customer and a network of part time specialist problem solvers have been around for some time, driven partly by the need for expert witnesses in US litigation. The Internet has always been critical to their business model as it allows the client to find an anonymous expert and seek their profile before submitting the problem, and makes relatively small transactions viable.</p>
<p>But now the problems being solved are not only technical ones but just about everything...</p>

BODY:
<p>We all know the Cloud is out there.&#0160;Delivery of IT Services across the Internet using massively scalable infrastructure is a reality.&#0160; But the Cloud is a dynamic thing: what you get today is not what you will get tomorrow.&#0160; </p>
<p>Industry analysts suggest that&#0160;small improvements&#0160;could be implemented on the Cloud now, but it will take around seven years for the Cloud to be fully mature and commoditised.&#0160; What does this mean in practice and how do you identify what will work today?</p><br />
<p>Well, let&#39;s look at some of the typical challenges facing a Cloud implementation:</p>
<p></p>

-----
EXTENDED BODY:

<p>- &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; SLAs based on availability rather than performance.</p>
<p>- &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Compensation for failure to meet SLAs limited to discounts on future usage rather than business cost incurred</p>
<p>- &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Possibility of data loss and security concerns over sensitive data - where is information held and under what jurisdiction?</p>
<p>- &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Inability to test disaster recovery procedures</p>
<p>- &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; No Internet means no service</p><br />
<p>As the Cloud evolves and matures, many of these issues will be addressed.&#0160; It is reasonable to assume that SLAs will become more aligned with end-to-end business services; that concerns about data integrity and security will be dealt with; and that, while it will still be true that no internet means no service, infrastructure improvements will significantly reduce the likelihood and the risk of service failure.&#0160; Many options will appear, ranging from the cheap and cheerful provision of large compute power to the enterprise-ready service with guaranteed performance, integrity and security.&#0160;But who wants to risk using the cloud in the meantime?</p>
<p>This continuing evolution of the Cloud means that implementing it is not a &quot;one-off&quot; exercise.&#0160; There are applications and services which it would be unwise to implement on the Cloud today but which will benefit enormously once a sufficient stage of maturity is reached.</p>
<p>As examples, consider two extremes.&#0160; A planning/modelling application which has no real-time requirements; is used only by a small number of people; processes data where the master copy is held in-house; and needs large computing power may be an ideal candidate for going to the Cloud now.&#0160; </p>
<p>By contrast, a core business system used by all employees on a continuous basis with a database holding sensitive information isn&#39;t going there any time soon.&#0160; In practice, many applications and services fall somewhere between the two extremes.&#0160; This means they might not be implemented on the Cloud now, but when the Cloud&#39;s capabilities have evolved sufficiently, a different decision is needed.</p>
<p>So perhaps one answer for today&#39;s best use of cloud is to start to develop an internal one and forget about&#0160;anything else&#0160;until 2016!</p>

<p><font color="black"><strong>Oliver Turnbull &gt;&gt; Everyone has a part to play in effective IT cost reduction.</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="black"><strong><br /></strong>In the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is King. These days, the Kings of IT need 20:20 vision to avoid spending more on IT services than they need to.<a href="http://www.atosoriginblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0112796dcbfa28a4011570843213970b-pi" style="FLOAT: right"><img alt="Oliver Turnbull" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0112796dcbfa28a4011570843213970b " src="http://www.atosoriginblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0112796dcbfa28a4011570843213970b-800wi" style="MARGIN: 5px" title="Oliver Turnbull" /></a> </font></p>
<p><font color="black">So how do we go about analysing whether we are spending too much on IT and what we can do to reduce cost? Does an accountant view cost reduction in the same way as a technician? Do process people think the same way as innovators? Can the fact that different people will come up with different solutions be useful to us? Yes, it can!</font></p><br />
<p><font color="black"><strong>The Financial Controller&#39;s Apples<br /></strong>An accountant might be interested in benchmarks to show how spending according to&#0160;the&#0160;chart of accounts compares with a peer group. But benchmarking models are notoriously unreliable and problematic. Do you ever truly compare &quot;apples with apples&quot;? Even in a confederated business model, IT budgets vary wildly: in the NHS, for example it is next to impossible to draw a correlation between IT spend and the type / size of a its constituent trusts and SHAs. But surely all acute trusts run hospitals whose only raison d&#39;etre is to make lots of people feel better? Look closer! If you rely just on the numbers (much as we love their apparent empiricism) you will miss other, vital saving opportunities.</font></p><br />
<p>&#0160;<font color="black"><strong>The Technologist&#39;s Tin<br /></strong>A technician will examine your tin, wires and software breathlessly evangelising about</font> <font color="black"><em>&quot;cloud computing&quot;, &quot;virtualisation&quot;, &quot;extreme collaboration&quot;, &quot;collective intelligence&quot;</em></font> <font color="black">and</font> <font color="black"><em>&quot;neurological hosting&quot;</em></font> <font color="black">as well they might as these are all very exciting concepts. And some of them might actually turn into reality one day! Probably not the last one though - I made that one up! But I might be on to something...&#0160; perhaps we could use the spare carbon-based capacity in our brains to augment a stretched silicon-based architecture...</font></p>

<p>- &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Is it a balanced analysis?</p>
<p>- &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Does it take into account past history and lessons learned?</p>
<p>- &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Are we aligned to the business needs, desires, strategies?</p>
<p>- &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Do we have an appetite for taking business risks?</p><br />
<p>&#0160;<strong>The</strong> <font color="black"><strong>Innovator&#39;s Dream<br /></strong>But what about the &quot;wacky&quot; stuff? Are we stuffy conservatives, constrained in our thinking and</font> stultified <font color="black">by fear? Are we afraid to &quot;think outside the box&quot; or will that make us sound like management consultants? Is neurological hosting really the next big thing which is going to be mandatory to assure my survival let alone allow me to prosper? Are we missing the boat? What&#39;s everyone else doing?</font></p><br />
<p><font color="black"><strong>The Customer&#39;s Value<br /></strong>And last (why always last?) are we giving our users what they want and do they therefore consider the services we offer to be of high value. By &quot;right sizing&quot; an IT service from a value perspective, we can not only make sure that the service the user experiences is &quot;fit for purpose&quot; but can also make sure that we are not &quot;over servicing&quot;. As we all know offering &quot;value&quot; is not the same as being &quot;cheap&quot;. If your finance team are happy with CashCalc V1.0, don&#39;t upgrade them all to V2.0 just because everyone else is doing it; find out whether it has the potential to improve their lives or you&#39;ll just get a training headache. But maybe they don&#39;t yet</font> <font color="black"><em><ins>realise</ins></em></font> <font color="black">how cool V2.0 actually is. Should you tell them? Probably. Delivering &quot;value&quot; is a balancing act: between giving the users what they want and letting them know what&#39;s out there to help them and make them happy. Like dealing with children really. See if you can persuade them to eat pineapple when they really really</font> <font color="black"><em><ins>really</ins></em></font> <font color="black">want chocolate!</font></p><br />
<p><font color="black"><strong>The Consultant&#39;s Focus<br /></strong>So, what&#39;s the answer? Obviously, the key is to examine the problem from a variety of angles (or through a variety of &quot;lenses&quot; if you&#39;d rather). Be analytical and methodical but also imaginative and unconstrained. Assign &quot;lens owners&quot; and act as judge when collating their outputs. You will have to be:</font></p>
<p>- &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <strong>scientific and honest</strong> about assessing any potential cost benefits both in terms of sizing, timing and likelihood of success;</p>
<p>- &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <strong>collaborative</strong> in meshing different initiatives together to create the dreaded &quot;synergies&quot; we hear so much about;</p>
<p>- &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <strong>brutal</strong> in the way you kill unworkable or non-strategic initiatives at birth; and</p>
<p>- &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <strong>pragmatic</strong> in picking the &quot;low hanging fruit&quot; which will give you results fast</p>
<p><font color="black">The good news is that numbers don&#39;t lie (although the method of their derivation can be suspect) and therefore your cost saving initiatives will be relatively easy to prioritise.</font> <font color="black">All you then have to worry about is turning your initiatives into a programme plan with all the inherent dependencies, constraints and blockers. But that&#39;s what the programme manager&#39;s lens is for...</font></p>
<p><font color="black">Following an approach like this, you will be confident that:</font></p>
<p>- &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; All angles are covered</p>
<p>- &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Everyone has had their say</p>
<p>- &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; You are maximising the benefits</p>

Oliver, This is a great article, i really enjoyed reading it. 
Do you feel that examining costs in a purely empirical way sometimes causes an organization to miss the boat? for example a large cost saving can often have a unexpected effects on the business, for example if a company were to buy cheaper equipment, staff retention may decrease. Do you feel that this is areal danger?

Thanks Simon. Very kind!
With regard to your comment, I agree wholeheartedly - focus on the numbers and you will miss a variety of cost saving opportunities! This is where the "Value" lens comes in. Value covers more than financial benefits but also looks at risk avoidance, strategic alignment to the business and the "softer" things like raising morale and brand strengthening. The trick is, and it is by no means easy, putting a "value" on these more "ethereal" benefit areas. Difficult, but not impossible! If you think about it long and hard enough, you can make some assumptions and ascribe a notional value to, say, increased morale: less people will leave - less knowledge will be lost - we will pay headhunters less - etc. It can be quite a challenge to create these logical benefit chains to compare apples with pears, but so long one doesn't over-analyse, it is more than doable....

Hi Oliver,
I'm reading a lot more about cost optimisation rather than cost reduction. How are these 2 concepts related?

I've come across "cost optimisation" a lot recently as well! And a fine concept it is too! 

As I understand the term, it complements our approach to accelerated cost reduction very well in that it mirrors our value lens nicely (pun intended!) - both approaches recognise the importance of not blindly slashing at the IT organisation without taking into account where the user can live without sub-second response times on their timesheet system, or the next version of their ERP solution which has voice recognition and an attractive Avatar feature! But I am very passionate about giving the user what they need rather than what they want!

Great article in both tone and content.  And I'm lucky enough to see this approach being applied 'live' on our current project.  Very nice.  I really appreciate the invitation to be creative and collaborative, and the discussion of value versus only cost savings.

Hi Bruno. Yes, of course. Innovations don't simply appear out of thin air. These dates are indicative of how far into the future you might reasonably expect these technologies and trends to be widely seen. Do you agree with the predictions?

A couple of points:

1. RFID will not replace barcodes until later in the decade, why? - cost of tag, compliance, industry standardisation (EU vs USA vs ASIA), full benefits not currently being fully realised.

2. Households pushing energy back to the grid, tiny percentage of households will achieve this, why? - cost of upgrading energy infrastructure, secure non-repudiated data transfer to allow accurate billing securely (of which I believe I have found the solution for), consumers not tolerating to "purchase" the technology to implement (they expect Government to fork out solution) and they will not tolerate the price hike from energy companies thereore impasse will develop unless a creative solution can be found that allows consumer buy-in at very little cost, inadequate capacity storage arrangements, power dissipation over distance, wind power vs alternatives (no clear strategy from the Government currently knee jerk reaction method(s)), sustainability at source required.

BODY:
<p class="MsoNormal">Last week, in my capacity as chair of its working
group on IT futures, I had the privilege to participate in the British
Computer Society’s thought leadership debate on ‘The death of the IT
profession’ – the provocative title for a debate on the direction of IT
professionalism. </p> <p class="MsoNormal">This is a very timely debate of course. As
information sharing becomes more central to the day to day of business
and society, the professionalism of those providing the enabling
products and services becomes more central too.</p> <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0cm;"> It was a productive evening, with 30
people or so in various leadership roles in the industry engaged in the
debate. The evening was kicked off by <a href="http://bcs.org.uk/server.php?show=ConBlog.20&amp;aboutAuthor=1">Chris Yapp</a> and <a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/cio/itprofession/team.aspx">Kate Silver</a>,
by providing a few minutes each on some serious thought provocation to
get us going. And so with people sat at one of four tables the debate
began. The fact that the food was good but hardly got a mention in
edgeways is a good indicator of the level of intensity of debate that
ensued.</p> <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0cm;">One of the
thought provoking inputs to the debate was, given the rise of the Web,
are the IT professionals of the future going to be solely those that
work for Google and the like, or, is <em>everyone</em> going to become an IT professional in some sense?</p><p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0cm;">This
debate is an important one not least because the usefulness and
ubiquity of IT to each of us in our daily lives is being matched by the
fall in the perception of the usefulness of the IT we have access to at
work, and yet there remain many considerations in the corporate
environment which require professional attention. </p><p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0cm;">Or to put it simply, the IT we use at home seems better now than the IT we use at work - and it&#39;s a heck of a lot cheaper.</p> <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0cm;">Of course, the question isn’t helped by the wide definition of ‘IT professional’ and perhaps here is the central point. Chris Yapp
provided a view that rather than a single IT profession, we are already
seeing three professions emerging specialising around information,
people, and software engineering. And <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/11063189611159076891">David Flint</a>,
one of the table rapporteurs of the evening, to my mind summed up the
feeling of the room neatly by articulating how many professions will
contain a significant element of IT professionalism within them. <o:p></o:p></p> <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0cm;"></p> <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0cm;">In embracing the issues, UK government is to be commended for its work here with its <a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/cio/itprofession.aspx">IT professionalism agenda</a>
- and Lesley Hume, recently appointed as Director of the Government IT
Profession, was at the debate (and was a very significant contributor
at our table!) </p><p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0cm;">The consensus
view is that the IT profession is evolving rapidly, and an executive
remit to embrace the emergence head-on feels like a must do rather than
a nice to have. And perhaps as a way to make a practical difference,
organisations could do worse than take a leaf out of Cabinet Office’s
book and create or boost a leadership role with responsibility
specifically focused on IT professionalism – both on best practices and
perhaps even more importantly, the next practices for the many ‘IT
related’ professions.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0cm;">This is for sure a lively debate, and expect to see it develop on the <a href="http://bcs.org.uk/server.php?show=ConBlog.20">BCS Futures blog</a> too.</p>

It's an interesting point of view, and one that builds upon the debate around the future of corporate business structures. Given generational change, ubiquitous connectivity and the continued energy put into individual persona and entrepreneuralism, how will organisations control, co-ordinate or incubate the distributed workforce? 

Of course that highlights the challenge - to move from "control" to "collaborate". Is the future about increased IT professionalism or is it as much about the ability to harness IT chaos and invention, turning that into accelerated value for businesses? I think it emphasises the need to explore different ways of working sooner rather than later - those that do will succeed faster on a global scale than those that rely on control.

<p>I attended a breakfast this morning (Wednesday) with Nick Herbert MP. Suitably inspired and enriched with sausage, fried egg and lapsang souchong I address my ‘electronic abacus’ (aka laptop) to crystallise some thoughts on public sector, enterprise and economic innovation…</p><p>In the current economic climate it is clear that the political agenda must focus on ‘more for less’. Read into this ‘targeted investment’, ‘efficiency savings’, spending reviews and strenuous testing of business cases. Innovation will be greatly aided in this sector by utilisation of domain experts, particularly those with pan-governmental experience. Deep understanding of legislative (UK and European) constraints as well as legacy public sector IT estates, business imperatives and pressures are (in my view) key prerequisites to driving major savings. Innovation will be required if ‘more for less’ is not to become ‘less for less’ and I think this will reinforce the need for exemplary working partnerships between public sector entities and private sector suppliers. Industry forums will facilitate debate and a ‘new’ receptive dispensation to ‘can I show you my wares’ would help in certain areas. Aspects of innovation are both iterative and cyclical and communication outside of formal ‘buy cycles’ will help all.</p><p>Taking a stance within the enterprise, innovation will be driven (partly) by increased process automation and business intelligence. Process improvement, smarter working, smarter sourcing are not mere platitudes. Repurpose, repackage, challenge the business and IT status quo. Innovation has the potential to be disruptive, but this should not be shied away from.</p><p>What stifles innovation?<br />1.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Inflexibility – “but we always do it that way”<br />2.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Cynicism – “things will never change”<br />3.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Lack of engagement – “not my responsibility”<br />4.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Lack of empowerment – “I don’t have the ‘clout’ to make an appreciable difference”<br />5.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Lack of incentive – “what’s in it for me”<br />6.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Fiefdoms – “I might lose control”<br />7.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Poor communications - “I didn’t realise that was so complex, expensive, etc.”<br />8.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Poor understanding of existing business model and processes (“innovation from ignorance” is really an exercise in luck)<br />9.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Too much rear view mirror analysis – “always looking back and being reactive”<br />10.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; FEAR of change – all of the above! – and lack of BELIEF.</p><p>What stimulates innovation?<br />1.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Innovation forums / workshops – ‘the <em>manual of continuous improvement husbandry</em>’ (<em>Nimmons, 2009, Fictional</em>) states such an ‘animal’ requires care and attention from all stakeholders. A BPO position of ‘manage my mess for less’ is a quintessential example of ‘head in the sand behaviour’<br />2.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Improved communications and sharing of issues (across companies and their suppliers)<br />3.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Domain specific knowledge and cross-fertilisation from other vertical industries (acknowledge the commonality in patterns)<br />4.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Banishment of blame culture <br />5.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Empowerment, and incentives – reward innovative thinking (but keep a sensible handle on long term strategy and risk management)<br />6.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Hearty breakfasts – (<em>stage direction: ‘editor coughs’</em>)</p><p>Temporarily donning an economist’s hat I think innovation (as much lauded in the media) is really a call for ‘renewed entrepreneurial spirit’. Britain has a long and distinguished history of invention, wealth creation and leadership in many scientific, engineering and technological fields. I think this is part of the very ‘fabric of our being’ and I would like to see an ‘innovation stimulus’ supported not only by private venture capital, but also by central, regional and local government.</p><p>In short, innovation is challenge. Innovation blooms under the ‘radiation’ of freedom, sponsorship, openness and experience. The successful entrepreneur brims over with self-belief, motivation and commercial agility. These are some of the ‘base elements’ I feel are central to ‘the alchemy of innovation’.</p>

<p>
</p><p></p><h3>Mick Bell &gt;&gt; Does the deal make sense?</h3><p>This is a landmark event in the IT world for many reasons, not least that it is the first major takeover of a hardware vendor by a software company - almost a reverse takeover. Looking forward to Oracle&#39;s future plans for this it is unclear whether this forms part of a grander plan to take on the likes of IBM and HP as all round providers.
</p><p><a href="http://atosoriginblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0112796dcbfa28a401156f78821f970c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Mick" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0112796dcbfa28a401156f78821f970c " src="http://atosoriginblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0112796dcbfa28a401156f78821f970c-800wi" style="margin: 2px;" title="Mick" /></a></p><p>But for today, there are clear advantages for Oracle, and for Sun:</p>
<ul>
<li>It secures a home for Java and Sun&#39;s Open Source products. </li>
<li>It significantly improves Oracle&#39;s product portfolio and should mean an increased share of the corporate wallet for Oracle - though this is a two-edged sword - already I have heard rumblings about over-reliance on a single supplier. Some of the Sun products are not significantly high profile, especially Storage, and I would not expect to see another Data Appliance offering from Oracle given the poor showing last time. 
</li>
<li>It secures a future for a world-class operating system - <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/" rel="nofollow">Solaris</a> - that seemed to be entering its last days. This is very good news for customers who have significant investments in Solaris. It also slows the demise of the SPARC chipset and gives a lifeline to existing Sun hardware customers, giving a breathing space to beef up the x86 product offerings. </li>
</ul>
<p>So yes, it would seem to make sense Oracle, Sun and the rest of us.</p><p><a href="http://atosoriginblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0112796dcbfa28a401156f7880e2970c-pi" style="float: right;"><br /></a> </p>
<p></p><h3>Java - Commercialise or Set Free?</h3><p>Sun never really made much money from Java and efforts from Oracle to do the same may similarly founder. It may be that Oracle do what Sun could never allow themselves to do - finally liberate Java and release it control of Java to the Java Community.</p>
<p>Java is key to the future of Oracle&#39;s software business, they will have to re-visit the Oracle/BEA technology roadmap once more to accommodate and assimilate the various Sun products - this could lead to further confusion amongst Oracle&#39;s customer base driving migrations towards IBM Websphere or Red Hat JBOSS if clarity is not achieved - it is vital that this activity is completed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Java is also key to a number of other vendors - not least IBM. Sun learned that to avoid a balkanisation of the Java market consensus had to be achieved, I hope that Oracle do not upset this consensus. Java is also important to other vendors, such as SAP - the major competitor to Oracle&#39;s ERP stable - SAP have been getting closer to Microsoft &amp; SQL Server at the low-end and IBM DB2 at the high end of customer installations - I would expect to see this process quicken.</p>

<br />
<p><a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/" rel="nofollow">JavaOne</a> in June this year is going to be the most important for many years.</p>
<p><strong>Open Source, Open Office and MySQL</strong><br />Oracle have been safe hands for Berkley DB and other Open Source tools, but hardly a major force like say IBM. The acquisition of Sun makes Oracle a serious player, not least because of the control of Java.</p>
<p>MySQL. In the Open Source community this is THE story, but I don&#39;t think MySQL was really an immediate threat to the database hegemony of Oracle in the short to medium term. It remains to be seen what Oracle intend to do with MySQL - so far there have been a lot of positive noises from them (to admittedly a highly cynical and suspicious audience). Enough of the core MySQL engineers had already left Sun to ensure a future for MySQL through the various new offerings popping up (Drizzle for example), and the skills exodus is likely to quicken unless Oracle can convince them to stay. I think if Oracle is serious they will need to be seen to be over-delivering in this area, otherwise they really should let it go.</p>
<p>OpenOffice. Oracle has really been absent from the clamour towards Cloud Computing, I would expect that the acquisition of StarOffice/OpenOffice will lead to an Oracle Cloud offering in the very near future - this would be a serious competitor to the Microsoft/Amazon/Google push - I would expect Oracle to focus on Corporate rather than Consumer markets. Given that Office is one of Microsoft&#39;s biggest earners I would expect investments in OpenOffice to accelerate rather than fall.</p>
<p>Only time will tell if this takeover is a catalyst to future world domination or just a bold attempt to keep Sun from the grim reaper....</p>

This looks to be a pre-emptive response to the looming threat caused by cloud computing allowing smaller operators to join together and threaten the likes of Oracle.

An all-in-one would appeal to big business and the security conscious - who could then use Oracle as an alternative to cloud. Smaller operators could take advantage of cloud, but mid-sized organisations will be faced with a difficult choice... highly priced all-in-ones or high risk from cheaper cloud alternatives...

Both open office and microsoft office are pretty much end of life technology. Oracle's interest in open office could be a foot in the door for large managed operations deals?

This acquisition poses many questions. Any comment must be qualified by the fact that the deal has to close and be acceptable to regulators. 

The future of MySQL must be in question - at the least Oracle can be expected to charge more for it - and logically Oracle would not want to support a product that directly competes with its flagship database. Oracle's position with Linux will also be interesting given that they see Solaris as a major reason for the acquisition. 

Although Oracle is not terribly interested in the hardware, the vast majority of Solaris installations are on SPARC processors rather than x86. The answers to these questions will become clear in coming months - until then it might be prudent to avoid new deployments of MySQL and SPARC devices.

Trying to double guess a large corporation's product stategy is a tricky proposition. 
Will Oracle neglect the Open Source responsibilities you would think are entailed in the Sun acquisition? Will Oracle use the MySQL product set to make inroads into business loss incurred with every SQL Server installation?
Will they leverage the Java space and finally present an integrated OracleDB/BEA/Java/Open Source/Hardware/Kitchen Sink offering that will extend their market share? That is what acquisitions are usually about. 
I can't see Oracle mothballing these significant lines of business.

As Johnny Nash said, "There are more questions than answers", which leads to defining integrators' approaches that can contain any likely outcome of Oracle's approach and strategy.

My guess is that agility will be the key, having a foot in many camps: Standard Oracle E Business Suite offerings, Workflow via Aqua Logic, Warehousing using Warehouse Builder, integration with Java/OracleDB etc etc etc. Niche operation in this space may not be viable for any reasonably sized company.

I will give a pound to the first architect who works on a project involving Oracle, Aqua Logic(or its equivalent BPEL clone) and Java in a cloud environment.  For the time being Legacy Rules OK ?

<p>The day shed light on variety of diverse topics and stimulated much debate about the hot topics and challenges of today. Throughout the day, the guests had the opportunity to explore:</p>
<p>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;- The rise of the multi-generational workforce and what Generation Y is threatening to do to their businesses with Atos Consulting&#39;s Marc Humphries;</p>
<p>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;- Guy Lidbetter presented the CTO&#39;s view on the nuances of Cloud Computing and the pros and cons of whether to adopt;</p>
<p>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;- Tim Harford, columnist at the Financial Times and best selling author of &#39;The Undercover Economist&#39; guided the audience through his fascinating perspective on how the downturn happened, what that is doing to innovation and what business should be doing now and next;</p>
<p>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;- Fergus Harradence from the Department of Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS) shed some light on how the government supports innovation in business and how to work with them to bring your innovative ideas to reality;</p>
<p>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;- Whether sustainability made good business sense was explored in a panel hosted byAtos Origin&#39;s Felicity Jurd, consisting of: our Head of Sustainability Jeff Chater; Oliver Greenfield, Head of Sustainable Business &amp; Markets at WWF-UK; David Metcalfe, the Director and Founder of Verdantix Ltd.; and Andy Togher, Director of Business Relations, Carbon Trust.</p>
<p>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;- Finally the guests were invited to participate in a workshop session led by Carl Bate of Atos Consulting, in which they explored the themes from the day and their own take on What&#39;s Hot and What&#39;s Not out there at the moment and their views on &#39;Innovating Innovation&#39;.</p>
<p>Guests were also able to play with some innovative technologies including:</p>
<p>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;- Infusion&#39;s fascinating demonstration of mapping software running on a Microsoft Surface (a lot of people found their houses through Virtual Earth on the Surface that day!);</p>
<p>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;- A demonstration of the Atos Consulting sustainability benchmarking tooling from Asam Salim</p>
<p>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;- The truth behind what goes into complex sites such as the National Express ticketing portal from Graham Bodman of Atos Origin</p>
<p>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;- Atos Worldline also demonstrated mobile barcoding and in particular mobile-based ticketing used in the aviation industry</p>
<p>Key themes to emerge from the day were especially: the business world&#39;s cautiousness of cloud computing as a serious consideration; the demand for Unified Communications; Sustainability as a mounting pressure; and scepticism about just how useful the surface technology could be!</p>
<p>In terms of innovation, the delegates talked on the challenge of innovating within their organisations, the need for innovation for survival, where the responsibility for innovation must lie, the aims of making it part of everyday life and relaxing some control to allow innovation to flourish.</p>

<div class="entry-body">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt">Six weeks ago, a significant policy change regarding the adoption of Open Source software (OSS) was issued by Tom Watson, Minister for Digital Engagement, after a last update dating back to 2004. Having worked myself a few years providing services around OSS for the French Government in the past, I find this move very interesting. With this change, the UK Government will be able to build upon the lessons learnt and the Best Practices that the industry has been defining over the last few years.</p></div>
<p class="entry-more"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt"><strong>Level playing field</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt">The new policy’s main goal is to provide a more “level playing field” between proprietary and Open Source Software in Government. It goes further than its continental European counterparts by encouraging new procurement rules to ensure an OSS option is included in every government IT procurement. This does not in itself enforce the use of OSS because the value for money and fitness for purpose criteria will still need to be demonstrated, as with proprietary software. However the policy explicitly gives an edge to OSS against proprietary software when these criteria are fulfilled, “on the basis of its additional inherent flexibility”. This feels quite sensible, realistic and objective in its principles. Yet, the question of <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">how</span> we can implement the action plan still has to be addressed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt"><strong>Open Standards and Re-use, the real winners</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt">Interestingly enough, the policy stresses that Open Source is not an end in itself but more a means to contribute to the “<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">wider aims of re–use and open standards</span>” and it is indeed sensible to position the debate at this level. Open Standards, interoperability and re-use are difficult to argue against when building better quality and cost-effective systems for citizens with taxpayers’ money. It is also an area where proprietary software vendors can - and will need to - openly compete.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt">Another interesting point is that the cost aspect is not directly mentioned as an advantage. This is again wise as the value for money argument can sometimes be fallacious because of the potentially significant hidden costs that can appear in under-considered areas such as management tooling, application management, support and training.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt">All in all, it’s no accident that the new policy is labelled “Open Source, Open Standards and Re–Use”. Some may find it confusing but they are actually all interlinked. Although Open Source is no silver bullet, it bears specific characteristics that can help achieve the other two. Here’s how.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt"><strong>Open Source and Open Standards&#0160;hand in hand</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt">Even if OSS doesn’t <em>mean</em> Open Standards, the reality is that they generally support and help each other: <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">
<p>OSS</p></st1:city></st1:place> often relies on Open Standards to stimulate adoption and Open Standards are typically implemented first in Open Source applications.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt">The Open Source community has recently even been more proactive by <strong>developing</strong> new International standards such as the Open Document Format, which has in turn forced major proprietary vendors to open their own formats. Policy changes like this&#0160;one allow these movements to be set into motion, promoting wider choice for the end-user and stronger competition between <strong>all</strong> software providers. It also triggers a new race for innovation and differentiation on added value rather than proprietary lock-in.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt"><strong>Open Source’s further re-use potential</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt">Open Source Software’s common reliance on Open Standards is one thing. However, OSS’ re-usability is also enhanced by its specific licensing principles and obviously by the openness of the source code itself. One must still watch out for the diverse licensing implications coming with all sorts of <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
<p>OSS</p></st1:place></st1:city> “flavours” though.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt">Even if this doesn’t ensure that it is easy to reuse <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
<p>OSS</p></st1:place></st1:city> in larger applications, it does enable its technical and legal feasibility. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt"><strong>Bringing it all together: intra-governmental collaboration</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt">This is one area, outlined in the policy, with high potential for UK Government and where Open Source Software has a power of its own. Many systems that are used locally in different areas of Central and Local Government are indeed similar in their functionality. In this respect, encouraging the collaborative development of cross-Government Open Source applications re-using existing Open Source stacks can be a good idea, especially if these common stacks are shared across all Government IT service providers, internal and external. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt">Existing Open Source stacks, tools and techniques, development methodologies and governance are particularly suited to achieving re-use through such collaboration projects. They have been in place for years to enable the efficient development of software by loosely coupled, geographically distributed teams of developers belonging to different types of organisation. This is exactly the same type of challenge that will be faced by cross-Government collaboration projects involving all types of actors within and outside the Government.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Work in progress…<o:p></o:p></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt">The principles are now laid out and overall they make sense, but the UK Government will need to go further in defining how they want to implement the action plan both internally and through the vendors who provide much of the IT across the public sector. Among other things:<o:p></o:p></p>
<div class="entry-more">
<ul>
<li>&#0160; Awareness must be built internally and externally on what Open Source is and isn’t, its different flavours, licensing variants, etc.<o:p></o:p> </li>
<li>A common Open Source selection methodology across the government needs to be defined or chosen/adapted from the ones already available: It must take into account Open Source specifics like project maturity assessment, community activity, community organisation, documentation, roadmap, availability of support offerings, etc.</li>
<li>A TCO model must be defined to measure the real cost for acquiring, using and operating Open Source alternatives. It must take into account “hidden costs” such as management tooling, application management,. support and training, This model must “plug into” the selection methodology,&#0160;</li>
<li>There is a need to implement a common repository for Open Source software evaluations, including TCO models, so they can be consistently applied,&#0160;</li>
<li>Reusing Open Source stacks involves the deployment of a common code and application repository across the Government,</li>
<li>Collaborating on intra-Government Open Source stacks requires defining the right Governance, as well as deploying Forge-like collaboration and development tools to support it,&#0160;</li>
<li>Development by an internal distributed community would involve adapting the development methodologies in place, from classic waterfall to rapid and frequent software iterations, etc.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt"></p>
<p>In short, there is still a lot of work ahead in order to make this policy a practical reality, but this first step hits the right nails by identifying Open Source as one of the tools to promote more openness and to deliver better services to citizens.</p>

BODY:
<p>The Guardian recently hightlighted a shift which I&#39;ve been monitoring for the last few months. Namely the swarming of the digital migrant generations onto social networking sites - especially facebook, and microblogging sites - specifically Twitter (which seems to have a regular slot on BBC news these days). </p>
<p>The Guardian quote quite startling figures which show that the majority of facebook users in the US are now over 25 (compare this to a grand total of roughly zero percent in facebook&#39;s fledgling years serving only colleges and Universities). Similarly, a recent study by <a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/twitters-tweet-smell-of-success/">Nielsen Wire</a> claims that the most prevalent users of Twitter are now in the 35 to 49 age group. Whether or not their survey is totally accurate is not worth debating as wherever you go, there&#39;s digital migrants swarming over Twitter.</p>
<p>What is it about this age group that means they suddenly love twittering and networking? </p>
<p>A lot of these new users are perhaps realising that their continued success in the future will depend on their personal online presence. Jobs and careers are already being made or broken through soloely online means. If you were looking to hire someone, where would you look now? Perhaps a quick look online to support their CV or reference from a job brokering site, but this will change to have more of an emphasis on the online presence. You would be more receptive to hiring someone if their work is laid bare on the internet for all to see.</p>
<p>This behaviour follows the standard pattern of digital migrants adopting something that the digital immigrants have taken hold of. What usually happens next in the cycle is the natives flee the now-mainstream into a new project. But this time it is not clear where the natives are going.</p>
<p>Social networking plugged a gap in the management of our social lives and allowed us to keep alive friendships that would certainly have died. Moving away from this would only take this away, and yet the pattern has always been for the natives to move on. </p>
<p>Are they going to stay with these now-mainstream tools or is the next big thing in its final testing stage waiting to woo the early adopters?</p>

Will,
I think it worth citing the recent article from Mashable (<a href="http://mashable.com/2009/04/28/twitter-quitters/)">http://mashable.com/2009/04/28/twitter-quitters/)</a> noting a 60% attrition rate in new Twitter users. Press coverage has caused a ‘rush to Twitter’ especially among those who want celebrity interaction. I think a once vanguard of Social Media, Twitter is descending into a mire of ‘soap box sound-bytes’. It is certainly a ‘technology’ I would describe as in the ‘storming’ phase.

The Twitter ‘natives’ you describe are increasingly going to FriendFeed. It has been a steadily (if quietly) growing domain of the ‘savvy’ for sometime. Use FriendFeed to sort the ‘good signals’ from the noise of lifestreaming. It also works great as an occasional Twitter client (although I supplement with both ping.fm and TweetDeck). If Twitter did make a blunder, I feel it was in not making its vanilla platform attractive enough, quickly enough. Features are beginning to appear (topic trending for example), but Twitter clients are already well established and these keeps eyeballs off advertising that Twitter could serve up and monetise. This is where Facebook really won out.

As for Facebook a lot of savvy players have again worked out that creating profiles (or pages) and adding 5,000 friends is a great way to create a highly interactive blog with a ‘captive audience’ with little or no capital outlay. Um, idea!

How people use these new tools is often more fascinating than the tools themselves. We are perhaps all simply ‘engineering presence’, and that opens up a can of worms in terms of ‘personal branding’…

<p>I&#39;m very pleased to see a phrase I have enjoyed using start coming more and more into the mainstream, &#39;Life Admin&#39;.</p><p>The term refers to all those little personal admin things in modern life that simply have to be done. Traditionally this has only scoped over bank statements, registering for council tax, remembering birthdays and that sort of thing. </p><p>Then came the internet and these things we saw as new opportunities and freedoms started to become extra admin weights around our necks. Why is it that with smart phones telling us birthdays, phone numbers, addresses, meeting reminders and all sorts of other useful things that things don&#39;t seem to be any easier?</p><p>When was the last time you remembered a phone number? How many numbers in your phone could you actually identify? That&#39;s another thing less to worry about from fifteen years ago - with lots of little improvements like this why don&#39;t we have so much more free time?</p><p>I suspect that every improvement leaves a gap that we are compelled to fill. SMS meant we didn&#39;t have to phone people for a quick issue, but then this led to having to manage calls and texts as well. Email now means we can replace SMS - picking up emails on the move theoretically frees up time in the office as the number of emails is not increasing, right? but this really doesn&#39;t seem to be the case!</p><p>Fifteen years ago, my morning obligations were check the (tape-based) answerphone, check my post and er.. that&#39;s about it.</p><p>Just look at my obligations every morning in this supposedly digitally-enabled world:</p><p>1 - Check my facebook for messages or events I need to make a decision about going to<br />2 - Check my twitter account and update with some drole comment<br />3 - Check my linkedin to see if my network is growing<br />4 - Check my emails from gmail, ymail, hotmail<br />5 - Check my smartphone for work emails<br />6 - Check my ebay for my want list<br />7 - Open msn and update my status</p><p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not alone in feeling the burden of all this and I&#39;m sure there are those whose lists are much, much longer!</p><p>Its no suprise that popular estimates suggest that the average office worker spends 40% of their year managing emails, I would very much like to know how much as a percentage of my life I now spend managing my online and offline personas and responsibilities!</p><p>So where am I going with all this? I can see a time in the near future where someone will see the potential for a tool that manages our now burgeoning and disparate communications tools and networks. Logging on to one place that lists and manages all my respsonsbilities.</p>

Businesses ask just the same question!

They invested in PCs and new software all with the promise of saved time, but people seem to be even busier.

It's not that these technologies don't provide advantage - they have transformed the workplace; it's just that the competition does it too, and in a while the increased productivity becomes the industry norm. 

The trend continues - technologies become more and more rich and intuitive so we don't have to 'remember' how to use them, and we can cope with more complex tasks in the same time as a result.

It's becoming a challenge when producing the business case for IT investment, since part of it is estimating the loss of business advantage from not investing as competitors move inexorably forward. 

The key for timing is to have a clear business driven strategy about where you are on the 'early adoption' curve, and a regular structured process to look at new innovative developments. This enables the business to move selected and appropriate new technologies through from proof of concept to mainstream within a consistent framework, which minimises cost of adoption.

This approach will produce the maximum competitive advantage in return for the inevitable technology investment.

Just don't, like BBC's Tomorrow's World in the 1970s, promise the business that the big problem of the future will be filling all the leisure time we have because of labour saving devices.

Do you ever remember not having a mobile phone?  Do you now a.  Get a sense of panic when you leave it behind, b. Shrug your shoulders and say voicemail will pick it up.  c. Turn the car around and drive back and get it?  What did you do before you had a mobile, I know I have 2 at the moment and it wears holes in my pockets.  

The increased leisure time we have is used now by checking emails and our social sites on the train with our PDA/Phone when before we may have lesurly read a paper for a more in depth review of news articles rather than snippets from the Internet.

We do have more leisure time, but we choose to use it poorly or work.  The individual makes the choice, do we have to have thousands of virtual friends and contacts?

Will,
I share your frustration. The fragmentation effect of ‘new’ or Social Media is really extraordinary. Writing some months back I described (somewhat pejoratively) the architecture of Social Media as an hallucinogenic spirograph, lots of interesting overlapping patterns with an oddly pleasing symmetry but with serious usability issues (I’m convinced it can be defined in fractals). Innovation drove fragmentation and people concentrated on quite a number of ‘Me 2.0’ services (how many Twitter clones!). Aggregation will eventually bring us back to sanity. Flock had a valiant try as a browser solution and there have been some reasonable Adobe Air based clients that were ‘useful’. Solutions like OpenID, Lifestream aggregators, mashups, open API’s, and ‘bridges’ like Google Friend Connect and Facebook Connect will all eventually glue together the ‘fractured shell’ of Social Media communications. Perhaps we’re on the verge of the invention of a ‘black box’ client for personal unified communications? I could really use some intelligent filters inside such a ‘device’ to prioritise all of my ‘listening’ devices across Social Media and help amplify the signal to noise ratio.   

I also really wish someone would invent an open API / standard (and yes please service) for profile management across disparate social networks.

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Work in progress…<o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">All these principles are now laid out and I do think overall
that they make sense. But the UK Government will need to go further in defining
how they want to implement the action plan <span style="text-decoration: underline;">internally</span>. Among other
things:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Wingdings;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">&#0160;
</span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Awareness
must be built internally and externally on what Open Source is and isn’t, its
different flavours, licensing variants, etc.<o:p></o:p></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Wingdings;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"></span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Wingdings;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"></span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&#0160;A
common Open Source selection methodology across the government needs to be
defined or chosen/adapted among the ones already available:<o:p></o:p></span></li>
</ul>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 6pt 0cm 0.0001pt 36pt; text-indent: -18pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;">o<span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;
</span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">It
must take into account Open Source specificities like project maturity
assessment, community activity, community organisation, documentation, roadmap,
availability of support offerings, etc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 6pt 0cm 0.0001pt 36pt; text-indent: -18pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;">o<span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;
</span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">It
must be able to give an indication of real Total Cost of Ownership for Open
Source alternatives, including “hidden costs” such as Application Management,
Training and Support,<o:p></o:p></span></p><ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Wingdings;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;
</span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">There
is a need to implement a common repository for such evaluations,<o:p></o:p></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Wingdings;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Reusing
Open Source stacks involves the deployment of a common code and application repository
across the Government,<o:p></o:p></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Wingdings;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Collaborating
on intra-Government Open Source stacks requires defining the right Governance,
as well as deploying Forge-like collaboration and development tools to support
it,<o:p></o:p></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Wingdings;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> Development
by an internal distributed community would involve adapting the development
methodologies in place, from classic waterfall to rapid and frequent software
iterations, etc.<o:p></o:p></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&#0160;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">In
short, there is still a lot of work ahead in order to make this policy a
practical reality, but this first step hits the right nails by identifying Open
Source as one of the tools to promote more openness and to deliver better
services to citizens.</span></p>

</p><p></p><p>The Internet has matured from originally providing static content though dynamic content/eCommerce to Social Networking and Web 2.0 and now the emergence of providing the core IT Infrastructure for running business applications and services that historically have been provided from dedicated infrastructure within the enterprise or within the Data Centre of a hosting partner or outsourcer (deep breath).</p><p></p><p></p><p>Or in other words - Cloud Computing.<a href="http://atosoriginblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0112796dcbfa28a401156eb5ee16970c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Guy187" class="at-xid-6a0112796dcbfa28a401156eb5ee16970c " src="http://atosoriginblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0112796dcbfa28a401156eb5ee16970c-200wi" style="border: 0px solid #ffffff; margin: 5px; width: 171px;" title="Guy187" /></a>

It offers that IT infrastructure transparently from data centres that could be anywhere on the globe and to which there is no direct connectivity. The infrastructure can be dynamically scalable usually through the use of virtualisation resources and automated provisioning and metering mechanisms which provide users with &quot;self service&quot; and &quot;on demand&quot; IT - both of which have been long held aspirations of utility compute models. In fact Cloud could be seen as the maturing of Utility Computing scaled up and let loose on the Internet.&#0160; The principles of both are very similar with subscription or usage/metered based commercial models.</div><p></p><p><br />Users need not have knowledge of, expertise in, or control over the
underlying infrastructure &quot;in the cloud&quot; that supports them. The
concept incorporates software as a service (SaaS), Web 2.0 and other
recent, well-known trends, in which the common theme is reliance on
Internet for satisfying the computing needs of the users. Often-quoted
examples are Salesforce.com and Google Apps which provide common
business applications accessed through a web browser online and Amazon
online services which provides server/storage infrastructure onto
which users can develop and deploy their own applications. Others are
coming with their own cloud services, including Microsoft&#39;s Business
Process Online Services (BPOS) amalgam of hosted Exchange, SharePoint
and&#0160; Office Comms Services&#0160; All share the same principle of the
software and data being stored on physical servers and storage in a
location that is completely transparent to the user.</p>

Guy,
This is a really good article and it has really got me thinking.

This is my definition of cloud computing 
Any feature that is delivered over the Internet where both the developer and user of the feature is abstracted from the infrastructure that provides it

If you gaze into your crystal ball would see cloud providers such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon ever adopting an open standard? So that applications could be moved from one to the other without cost or IT pain ?

In response to Simon's question I'd see three usual suspects power blocks: IBM, Oracle/Sun, and Microsoft competing to offer their own clouds.  I would imagine (foresee, I mean) that each would take their traditional stances to openness between them.

The interesting spin might come from the non-traditional entrants such as Amazon and Google, whose technical leanings would be subsumed by their commercial ones.  They would be the more natural allies with perhaps Sun to develop open standards.  And these would be grasped with the usual alacrity.  Bear in mind how long it has taken open standards to dominate where they now do. OK, I know the internet has changed everything and that cycle times are shorter these days..

So Oracle acquire Sun Microsystems. I did not know that when I posted earlier (on the same day it was announced), and I'd say here comes some of the condensation from which clouds are formed.  Expect Oracle to leverage this soon. And offer StarOffice as its cloud-based Office environment.

These are relevant points and well trodden pastures within the cloud debate. Open standards by definition make vendor offerings less sticky so the commercial providers are unlikely to find such an approach compelling.

History dictates that such standards will evolve from one of 2 sources - regulation or disruptive forces from without the mainstream.  In this case, the latter is more likely.  For example, imagine a philanthropic group of like minded people who offer access to their personal infrastructure for use by the collective. They therefore set up their own set of rudimentary standards which gather pace and evolve with new contributions becoming subject to an emerging governance structure and eventually evolve into de facto open standards. This is more or less the story of the evolution of Linux and Open Source in general - Open Cloud if you will. Whether it will pan out like that remains to be seen and it could also be that client demand pressures the different vendors towards a similar approach.

Google and Amazon are very different in that Google want you to consume their applications but Amazon just to put your applications on their infrastructure.  It's not hard to predict therefore that Amazon are more likely to suffer from ease of movement than the more sticky application based Google.  Conversely, if you don’t want to be tied to a vendor for important apps you may prefer not use the more sticky services so you retain the flexibility - horses for courses as always.

We are in the process of publishing a white paper on how to maximise the true benefits of virtualisation which makes the point that it needs to apply across all of server, network and storage.  The final conclusion is relevant to the benefits that the Open Cloud concept would bring - as virtualisation technologies and cloud standards evolve and mature, integrated virtualisation could even enable complete workloads to move from one provider to another in a non-disruptive manner. Virtualisation vendors are already looking at the ability to move virtual machines between different cloud infrastructures without down time.

There is an on-going debate about whether 'cloud computing' really does only mean 'internet-based' or whether it should include internal and private clouds. A recent article by the Burton Group ('Cloud Computing: Transforming IT') argues that cloud computing covers internal clouds as well, describing an internal cloud as "an IT capability offered as a service by an IT organization to its business". It quotes an example where "IT organizations building highly virtualized environments can become infrastructure providers to internal application developers". It further recommends building an internal cloud as a step towards an external cloud service.

The argument against this notion of 'internal clouds' is based on the fact that many of the fundamental principles defining 'cloud computing' are not met by it. First, internal clouds are not scalable to the degree implied in cloud computing (although remember that one of the bastions of cloud computing is not that of infinite scalability but that of the customer's perception thereof). Second, with an internal cloud the company still has the up-front capital expenditure whereas the removal of this is a major selling point of cloud computing. Third, the economies of scale, obtained through multi-tenanted facilities, is not something an internal cloud can offer by definition. 

One could argue that the debate is purely about semantics, and that in purely architectural terms it doesn't matter whether the cloud is internal or external. Personally I agree with that only in principle. Pragmatically, the growth or not of cloud computing in the enterprise is going to be about key business factors - ROI, SLAs, risk management, vendor tie-in, and data security.

Watch this space!
